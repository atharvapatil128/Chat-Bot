JAKE," This job is eating me alive. I can't breathe anymore. I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat. I'm not becoming like them. I am them."
AMY," Hey! What are you doing, weirdo?"
JAKE," I'm doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. Or actually, ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. [He stares at the screens of himself.] 'Sup?"
AMY," Get it together, man. Okay?"
AMY," So the store was hit about two hours ago. They took mostly tablets, laptops, and cameras."
JAKE, Sorry.
AMY," I'd like a list of all your employees, whoever had access to the store. I'd also like to apologize for my partner. His parents didn't give him enough attention."
JAKE," Uh, Detective... I already solved the case. We're looking for three white males, one of whom has sleeve tats on both arms."
AMY, And how do you know that?
JAKE," I had an informant on the inside. He's been here for years. Watching, learning. Waiting. His code name? [He holds up a stuffed bear.] Fuzzy Cuddle bear. He's a nanny cam. [He flips the bear over to show the electronic device inside, which appears to be the end of a You got lucky."
JAKE," No, I got here five minutes before you and figured that in this gigantic electronics store, there had to be at least one working camera. [He plugs the camera into the TV screens, broadcasting the recorded video of two guys stealing. We see their face clearly.] Oh! Hi, bad guys! [He looks to the bear] You did it, fuzzy. You busted 'em. It's time to come home."
JAKE,"  I'm not sure if I can. I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am. I have seen terrible things. I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons."
AMY, All right.
JAKE, Detective Santiago! Don't walk away from me!
JAKE," Yes, I did crack the case. So, Santiago, would you do the honors?"
AMY, I hate this!
JAKE," Ah, yeah. And you're just gonna add one."
JAKE, I'm winning.
AMY, I hate this!
JAKE, It's a good feeling. It's a good feeling. Yeah.
AMY, Enjoy it while it lasts.
JAKE, I will!
TERRY," JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?"
CHARLES, I think it was flan.
JAKE, Charles thinks it was flan. I think it was butterscotch pudding.
ROSA, Maybe it was just old person gunk. You know how old people always have that gunk on them.
JAKE," Oldie gunk. Could be, yeah. Anyone else?"
TERRY, How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?
AMY, Crime techs are at the scene now. We're heading back when they're done.
TERRY," Okay, I want you on this. It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O."
ROSA," Wait, tell us about the new Captain."
TERRY, Captain Holt will be here soon. He'll wanna introduce himself. Dismissed.
CHARLES," Hey, Gina. You know any scalpers? I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out. [The camera zones on Rosa at the end of the room, getting a paper out of the file box.]"
GINA," Okay, two points to make here. First, Rihanna... You... [She looks disappointing.] And then Rihanna. [She flares her hands in the air to emphasize on the point.]"
CHARLES, Yeah. What's your second point?
GINA, She's got a type. Which is really anyone but you.
CHARLES," Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too."
GINA," Look, a Rihanna concert's a pretty big swing, man. I don't know. She's into watching old movies."
CHARLES, Cool. Where would I find a place that shows old movies?
GINA," Oh, yeah, just go on the Internet and search for the phrase ""I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn't like me."""
CHARLES, Great. Thank you.
GINA, Good...
AMY," Hey, you heard anything about the new Captain?"
JAKE," Uh, no, and I don't care. I just wish Captain McGintley never left, he was the best."
AMY, He was terrible. You just liked him 'cause he let you do anything you wanted.
JAKE," On your marks, get set..."
MCGINTLEY, What the hell's going on around here?
JAKE, Fire extinguisher roller chair derby?
MCGINTLEY, Okay.
JAKE, And go!
JAKE, Yeah!
JAKE, What's your point?
AMY," If I'm ever gonna make Captain, I need a good mentor. I need my rabbi."
JAKE," Sorry, dude. But this new guy's gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who's only concerned with [He imitates a robot.] Following every rule in the patrol guide. Meep morp zeep. Robot Captain Engage."
MAN, Is that what you think?
JAKE, He-hey! New Captain alert. You must be the new C.O. I'm Detective Jake Peralta. Great to meet you.
HOLT, Now don't let me interrupt. You were describing what kind of person I'm gonna be. I'd like you to finish.
JAKE," That's not necessary.Or I could recap very quickly, sure. Um, let's see. I think I said some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher."
HOLT, Now do the robot voice.
JAKE, Which-
HOLT, The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot. I wanna hear it again.
JAKE, Meep morp zarp. Robot.
HOLT, That's a terrible robot voice.
JAKE, Yep.
HOLT," The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie."
JAKE," Oh, actually, the last Captain didn't care if we wore ties."
HOLT," Well, your new Captain does. And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders. [He then turns to the rest of the detectives and officers in the precinct.] Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt."
AMY, Speech!
HOLT, That was my speech.
AMY, Short and sweet.
HOLT," Sergeant Jeffords, a word. "
TERRY," Yes, sir."
AMY, I love that guy.
JAKE, Same!
GINA, He's so suave. Does anyone get a little bit of a gay vibe? [Everyone is quiet.] No? Okay.
HOLT," Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me. Though you were significantly..."
TERRY," Fatter, sir. They called me ""Terry Titties."" Because I had large, uh..."
HOLT," Titties, yes. I remember. I never liked that nickname. Though to be fair, it was accurate. What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?"
TERRY," A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls. [He shows Holt his wallet with the photos of his kids.] Cagney and Lacey."
HOLT, They have adorable chubby cheeks.
TERRY," Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt. Lost my edge. There was an incident in a department store."
JAKE," Hey, man, you okay? You look a little jumpy."
TERRY, I'm fine. I'm fine.
JAKE, I think he's dead.
TERRY, And I'm still not right.
HOLT, Tell me about your Detective squad.
TERRY," Um... Well, Scully, Hitchcock They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee."
HOLT, Copy that.
TERRY, Now the good ones. Rosa Diaz.
ROSA, Tell me who has me for Secret Santa.
HITCHCOCK, No! That takes all the fun out of it.
HITCHCOCK, It's Scully. He got you a scarf. I'll make him return it.
ROSA," Yes, you will."
TERRY, Charles Boyle.
TERRY," He's a grinder. Not the most brilliant Detective, but he works harder than anyone else. He's not physically... gifted."
CHARLES," Oh, man! My muffin. Ahh! Oh, my head! [He looks to the muffin which he accidentally stepped on.] My muffin, my head! And I stepped on the- On my muffin! And my head and my muffin."
TERRY, Amy Santiago.
TERRY," She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough."
SCULLY, Careful. That stuff's pretty hot.
AMY," Oh, is it? Hmm?"
TERRY," She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year. Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up."
HOLT, Tell me about Peralta.
TERRY, Jacob Peralta is my best Detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.
HOLT, That was very well put.
TERRY, I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.
HOLT," Look, you know my history. You know how important this is to me. This precinct is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn. And I need your help."
TERRY," Absolutely, sir. Where do we start?"
JAKE, What is happening?
HOLT, We start with him.
JAKE," Okay, so the perp came in through the window, "
AMY," Shell casing found here. Two shots. Bang, bang"
JAKE," Great work, Detective. You get a tie."
CHARLES," Hey, that's mine. You took it from my desk."
JAKE," That's right, Charles. Good solve. Tie for you. "
CHARLES, Thanks!
JAKE, Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes - unless you're wearing a tie.
AMY, Lay off the Captain. That man is gonna be my rabbi.
JAKE," Okay, first of all, when you use the word ""rabbi,"" you know that turns me on and that's unfair in the work environment. Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass."
CHARLES," Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?"
ROSA, He seems cool.
CHARLES," Yeah, he seems cool. I agree."
ROSA," Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon Iberico ham, valued at what! $6,000."
JAKE," $6,000 for a ham?"
CHARLES," Jamon Iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle's funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I mean, I was constipated for three days."
JAKE," Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you. [Charles laughs.] All right, listen up, everybody. Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation."
HOLT," Speaking of ties, where's yours, Meep Morp?"
JAKE, This is fantastic. Captain! Hey! Welcome to the murder. What are you doing here?
HOLT, I like to know what my detectives are up to. That okay by you?
JAKE, Yep.
HOLT, Take Santiago and knock on doors. See if the neighbors heard anything.
JAKE, Door duty? It's a waste of time.
HOLT, Diaz and Boyle. Check in the coroner. Report back to me in an hour.
JAKE, That went well.
HOLT," No, it didn't."
JAKE, He's got like super hearing.
CHARLES," Hey, Rosa! Rosa. Rosa! Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week. Wanna go?"
ROSA, Sure.
CHARLES, Cool! Awesome. There's a bunch of movie options.
CHARLES, I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.
ROSA, Citizen Kane is terrible. Pick a good movie.
CHARLES, Good call. Smart.
CHARLES, I'll do it. I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.
HOLT, So Gina. Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground. What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?
GINA," I will tell you on six conditions. Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves. Second-"
HOLT, How about this? If you tell me-
GINA, Mm-hmm.
HOLT, I won't have you suspended without pay.
GINA," Oh, that sounds great. Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car. It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet. If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him. He guarantees it will end in sex. I bet on at least some over-the-clothes action. At the very least, some touching-"
HOLT," No, that's enough, Gina."
GINA, Caresses. I could see him showing up in a silk robe.
HOLT," That's enough, Gina."
GINA, All right.
HOLT, Thank you.
JAKE, Let the wasting of time begin.
AMY," Hello, sir. Can we ask you a few questions?"
GUY, Definitely. Yeah. I'm actually I'm super glad you guys are here right now. Are you smelling that weed smell?
GUY," Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted."
JAKE, Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor?
JAKE," Ah, Captain. You're at my desk. Just what I wanna see first thing in the morning."
HOLT," You're three minutes late, Peralta."
JAKE, Not my fault. I had a plumbing problem.
JAKE," Which reminds me, I'm gonna need a new departmentally issued phone. Oh, come on, really? I'm a few minutes late, so you're gonna call me out in front of everyone?"
HOLT," Good idea. Everyone? Gather round, so I can call out Peralta in front of you."
JAKE," Okay, fine. I was three minutes late. I'm sorry for doing one thing wrong."
HOLT," Oh, it's more than one thing."
JAKE, Uh-oh.
HOLT, Let's start with the Kristov murder.
JAKE, It was an amazing solve. I got him to confess in 20 minutes.
HOLT," You also mislabeled the evidence, so that confession is worthless if the sergeant hadn't caught your mistake. Here are three cases with sloppy paperwork. Here are two pictures. One is your locker. The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines. Can you tell which is which?"
JAKE, That one's the dump?
HOLT, They're both your locker.
JAKE," Gah, I should've guessed that. He's good."
HOLT," This folder is labeled ""undies, dirty.”"
JAKE," So I won't confuse it with ""undies, clean."" Also, who cares about all these rules? I have more felony arrests than any other detective here."
HOLT, You also have more mice living in your desk than any other detective.
JAKE," ""Algernon."" ""You guys, Algernon's back."""
HOLT," Get rid of the mouse, and get your act together now."
JAKE, He's grumpy.
TERRY," Okay, detectives, let's get started. Santiago, where are we with the Jay Street drug bust?"
AMY," There are 12 keys of coke unaccounted for, but we just got a warrant to search the dealer's apartment."
TERRY, Good. Take Boyle and Diaz.
CHARLES, Dream team.
TERRY," Peralta, brief us on the vandalism case."
JAKE," Well, there's no easy way to put this, Sarge, but someone has been painting wieners on squad cars."
JAKE," And apparently, they won't stop until there's a penis drawn on every cop car in Brooklyn."
HITCHCOCK," Oh, that's what he's been drawing. But what are those little round things at the bottom?"
SCULLY, That's the butt.
JAKE, The butt?
HOLT, I assume you have a plan to catch this gentleman.
JAKE," Did you just say ""genital-man""? Because if so, kudos, and yes, I have a plan. I'm gonna plant a decoy squad car as bait. Meanwhile, I'll be waiting in an undercover vehicle here. He's already tagged three U/C vehicles."
TERRY, He can clearly spot 'em. You should take my minivan.
ROSA, A minivan? A-ha!
TERRY, You all got a problem with my minivan?
TERRY," ‘Cause my wife doesn't like it either. She wanted an SUV, but those things roll, man. They roll!"
HOLT," That's a good idea, sergeant. We'll take the van."
JAKE," We? You're coming with me? Sir, with all due respect, I don't need backup."
HOLT, It's not backup. It's babysitting.
ROSA, Babysitting. A-ha!
CHARLES," Oh, look at this. The drug dealer got a B.A. in art history from Brooklyn college. Interesting, huh?"
ROSA, How's that interesting?
CHARLES," Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied... drugs."
AMY, I studied art history too.
ROSA, Also not interesting.
GINA," Excuse me. I know I'm just a lowly civilian administrator, but I couldn't help overhearing you're looking for some missing drugs? As it turns out, my friend here, Carlene, is a psychic, and she's ready to help you."
CARLENE," I do palms, tarot, and I have a degree in numerology from the internet."
ROSA," Ugh. Really, Gina? A psychic?"
GINA," What? She's the real deal. E.G., last week, she predicted I would have a sensuous encounter with a guy named Mark. And I did."
GINA, Is anyone here named Mark?
GINA, You're good.
GINA," Okay, she's had visions which, frankly, science cannot account for. Also, she can get you amazing deals on ladies' footwear. She's assistant manager at Leonard's designer shoes."
CARLENE, Vision. The drugs are in a location. I see the color blue...
GINA, She sees blue.
CARLENE," And yellow. And I see the letters ""L"", ""R"", ""S"", ""T"", ""W"", ""E"", and ""B."""
AMY," So basically, everyone's first eight guesses in hangman?"
ROSA," Thank you, Carlene. Your entire life is garbage."
JAKE," So Holt's coming on my stakeout now? I made a mixtape with some very explicit rap on it, and now I can't sing along."
TERRY, You made a mixtape?
JAKE," Yes, I still listen to cassettes. This guy is all over me. I mean, a Captain on a minor vandalism case? It's insane."
TERRY," What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program. There is a new sheriff in town, Jake."
JAKE," Well, I like the old sheriff. I mean, McGintley wouldn't care about a messy desk or all these stupid rules."
ALL," Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase..."
MCGINTLEY, Hey! What the hell's going on here?
JAKE, Science experiment. I wanna see what happens if I taser this cantaloupe.
MCGINTLEY, Okay.
ALL," Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase... Aha. Oh! Yeah! "
JAKE," And McGintley wouldn't care if I was three minutes late 'cause he was always an hour late and hungover, and he would let you do literally anything you want if you gave him a hamburger."
TERRY, Did he let you play your mixtape?
JAKE, Okay. That's very funny.
TERRY," Get an iPod, man."
JAKE, Mixtape.
CHARLES," I just want to apologize for my fellow detectives’ behavior. Okay, my granny also had the gift."
GRANNY, I feel that I will die soon.
CHARLES, She was right. She died two years later.
CARLENE," Your sincere belief in my gift means a great deal. Vision. The woman you love, the one you work with, the scary one with the black hair..."
CHARLES, Rosa. Yes?
CARLENE, She doesn't love you back. She will never love you back.
GINA," Say ""thank you,"" Charles. She just told you your future."
CHARLES, Thank you.
JAKE, You left without me.
HOLT, You were late again.
JAKE," Well, I had to put on my undercover minivan disguise. Say hello to Harvey Norgenbloom, CPA, recently divorced father of two with a dark sexual secret. What's your cover?"
HOLT, Angry Captain.
JAKE," Okay, so you do not like my ensemble."
HOLT, I'm just concerned that you may find it hard to pursue a criminal on foot while wearing man sandals.
JAKE," But the sandals define Harvey. He's a sandals guy. [sighs] Captain, why the babysitting? Why are you micromanaging me?"
HOLT, You think I wanna be sitting here with you instead of running my precinct?
JAKE, Yes.
HOLT," It was a rhetorical question. I've spent the last 12 years fighting for my first command, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up because you refuse to take your job seriously."
JAKE," Hey, I do take my job seriously. I put away bad guys. That's what matters."
HOLT," Well, so does doing your paperwork, showing up on time, wearing proper footwear."
JAKE, That's on Harvey. That's not me.
HOLT," Well, so here's the deal. You're gonna have a superior officer babysitting you on every one of your cases. And when you show me that you can do your job... Every part of your job... Perfectly, then I'll back off."
JAKE," Okay. Counteroffer. I give you 50 bucks, and you let me do whatever I want. Fine. We'll do it your way. From this point on, I'll do every part of the job perfectly, perfecter than perfectly."
HOLT," It's ""more perfectly."" You said that imperfectly."
JAKE, I was testing you. You did perfectly. Quick update on the tagger situation... He is currently spray-painting our van right now.
HOLT," Police, freeze!"
JAKE," Ow, ow, ow. Sandal down. Lost a sandal. NYPD, freeze! I'm here. You're busted."
HOLT, Already got him.
JAKE, We got him.
JAKE," Oh, hey, Captain. Hi, so I was able to procure that $50 after all, and my offer still stands. Let me do whatever I want, and the $40... That's how much I actually have... is yours. No? Fair enough. I only had 30 anyways. Well, I guess in order to get you to stop micromanaging me, I'm gonna have to get back to the most important piece of police work there is: Writing a perfect report"
HOLT," Good, I'm anxious to read it."
JAKE, And I'm anxious to restore my status as a lone wolf. [Howls]
HOLT," Anything else, Detective?"
JAKE," Yeah, I'm gonna do one more. Lone wolf. He's digging me."
JAKE," Hey, Sarge, do you know where we keep the glitter? Just wanna make sure this report for the Captain is extra sparkly."
TERRY," What are you doing, Peralta?"
JAKE," Look, if I have to do things his way, I'm gonna do them my way."
TERRY," Okay, man. It was nice working with you."
JAKE," I'm not scared of him, okay? I'm not scared of anyone. Oh, also, The Tagger drew a penis on your minivan. I'm sorry. Please don't chase after me."
TERRY, What? There's a penis on my minivan?
AMY," High ceilings, three bedrooms. Why does every perp have a nicer place than I do?"
ROSA, You know what they don't teach you at the academy? It's better to be a criminal.
CHARLES," Oh, no. The cabinets are blue."
AMY," Tacky. Not a deal breaker, though. I'd just repaint it."
CHARLES, The psychic predicted the drugs would be found in something blue.
CHARLES, She also made this really depressing prediction about my life.
CHARLES," And if she's right about where we find the drugs, that means she's right about the other thing."
AMY, Uh-huh. Kitchen. Whoa. Jackpot. There's way more than 12 keys in here.
ROSA, Where was it?
AMY," Baseboard, behind the hamper."
CHARLES, What color was the hamper?
AMY, Green.
CHARLES, Yes. The clothes hamper was green. The clothes hamper was green! Drinks on me.
ROSA, You're weird.
JAKE," Sorry this is taking so long. Still writing up my report. Pretty detailed. Hey, Gina, can you look up what the humidity was about an hour ago and also what moon cycle we're in?"
GINA," No, sorry. Don't feel like it, no."
JAKE," Thanks, Gina. And now to you. What's your name?"
PRIVILEGED KID," My name is Banana Fartman, MD."
JAKE," I don't believe you. Come on, man. Just tell me who you are. I need to fill this thing out perfectly, so my boss will get off my back. Are you a minor? How old are you?"
PRIVILEGED KID, I'm 610. I'm a highlander.
JAKE," Okay, you know what? I'm gonna put that in there. And then you're gonna be tried as an adult highlander. And they're gonna cut your head off. Is that what you want?"
CHARLES," I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong."
GINA, Mm-mm. No way. She's never wrong.
CHARLES," We found the cocaine behind a green hamper. Never said green or the letter ""H."""
GINA," Mm-hmm, she said ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" Charles. I don't know if there's any kindergarteners present, but those two colors combined make green. She also mentioned the letters ""L"" and ""B,"" and another name for a hamper is..."
CHARLES, Lady bin?
GINA," Laundry basket. Oh, little boo-boo. Can you go be depressed over there? You're bumming out my whole area."
TERRY," Baby, I've got some bad news. Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan. No, you cannot have an SUV now. Those things roll, baby. They roll!"
JAKE," Hey, look at this. Your prints were on file. Nice to meet you, Trevor Podolski. Oh, Podolski, just like Deputy Police Commissioner Podolski. Your father is Deputy Police Commissioner Podolski."
TREVOR," I’m not sure how things work here, but does that mean that your career is in my hands?"
JAKE," Okay, you know what? Yes."
AMY, 20.2 kilos. I feel like we could round up to 21.
GINA," Or we could round down to 20, take the extra 0.2, sell it to our friends."
AMY," I’ll call the D.A. Rosa, you log this in. Charles, maybe watch Gina."
ROSA, So what are you doing tonight?
CHARLES, Nothing. What about you... are doing tonight?
ROSA, Nothing.
GINA, Carlene.
CHARLES," Whelp, I hope you find something to do. I’m gonna pee. That’s what I’m doing tonight. No."
HOLT," Deputy Commissioner’s son, huh? His decision to target cop cars makes a lot more sense now."
JAKE," We gotta let him walk, right?"
HOLT," He defaced nine police vehicles, and you caught him red-handed. Why would you let him walk?"
JAKE," Captain, I did all the work on this perfectly. I mean, my report has over 25 pages of meticulous research, diagrams, and maps. I even put an “About the Author” section on the back. [flips it to show a dramatic picture of him on the back] I did everything you asked me to do. But this is above my pay grade. You gotta make the call."
HOLT," You’re the arresting office. It’s your call. I told you to do every part of your job, and making this call is part of your job."
JAKE," Yeah, but you think I should process him."
HOLT, Mm-hmm.
JAKE," Well, if I do, the Deputy Commissioner could ruin my career, and I’ll end up on the streets selling my beautiful body for a can of beans."
HOLT, Mm-hmm.
JAKE, Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like a statue?
HOLT, Yes.
CHARLES," Man, you were totally right about the cocaine, and you were also right about Rosa."
CARLENE, Who’s Rosa?
CHARLES, The woman I--
GINA, The woman who doesn’t love him back.
CARLENE, Oh.
CHARLES," Yes, that woman."
CARLENE," You know, it can be a burden to always know what’s gonna happen in the future."
CARLENE, Don’t get out of the chair! I just had a vision of you leaving this chair and getting seriously injured.
CHARLES," Oh, my god."
GINA, I should probably wheel you back to your desk.
CARLENE, That is a great idea.
GINA," Wheel you off a bridge. I’m kidding. Oh, you’re alone. Uh-oh, you’re alone for life."
JAKE," So here are my options. One, I process Podolski’s kid, he fires me, and I spend the rest of my career as a detective, third grade, which is literally pathetic. No offense, Hitchcock."
HITCHCOCK, None taken.
JAKE," Option two, I let him walk, and I spend the rest of my life with Holt as my babysitter. Honestly, when I think about spending the rest of my life with a babysitter, she’s kind of a cute blond named Erica, and she always has pizza money and lets me stay up as late as I want."
AMY, How old are you in this scenario?
JAKE," Anyway, the point is Holt cares more about whether I “do my job right” than whether I have a job at all. So I’m taking suggestions."
AMY," I say piss off Holt, so we get to watch your career end right in front of us."
JAKE," Okay, thank you for that, Santiago. [turns to his whiteboard and puts a mark under ‘dont arrest’] I’m gonna put you down for “don’t arrest,” and I’m also going to put your phone number on every urinal in Rikers."
ROSA," Don’t arrest him. Just smack him. Hard. With a phone book on a body part no one can see, you know what I’m saying?"
JAKE, So you’re suggesting police brutality?
ROSA," Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah. Why?"
JAKE," Hey, Scully."
SCULLY, Yeah?
JAKE," You want this collar? Paperwork’s all done, and it’s perfect."
SCULLY, The Podolski kid? Are you kidding? I just gave him my lunch.
JAKE," Okay. Boyle, what do you think?"
CHARLES," I don’t know, man. I’m lost. The universe is a cruel and vexing puzzle. I-I’m at the whim of the cosmos."
JAKE," Alright, I’m gonna put you down for “bummer.” And you can hang out in that category all by yourself."
GINA," Hey, everyone. Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy, angry official here, Deputy Commissioner Podolski. He’s asking for you. Very angry. Elderly, sexy, furious. [walks away]"
JAKE," Well, my career is over. See you at the bottom, Hitchcock. No offense."
HITCHCOCK," No, none taken."
JAKE, Deputy Commissioner.
PODOLSKI, Where’s my son?
JAKE," He is at my desk, enjoying a nice glass of bubbly water and some chocolate I was saving for a special occasion."
AMY," Hey, Peralta, when you’re done, can you help me wrap up this massive cocaine bust I just pulled off? [pats Jake’s shoulder] Thanks. Oh, Deputy Commissioner, didn’t see you there. Sorry for interrupting. Amy Santiago."
PODOLSKI," Trevor, what’d you do this time?"
TREVOR, Nothing.
PODOLSKI, There you have it. He said he did nothing.
JAKE, So I caught him red-handed doing nothing?
PODOLSKI, I’m saying maybe it’s a possibility you made a mistake.
JAKE," You know, normally, I would agree with you, but I’ve been pretty detail-oriented the last few hours."
PODOLSKI," You might not understand this, but Trevor is a special kid. He makes straight A’s. He’s going to Duke next year. Lacrosse scholarship."
JAKE, Oh.
PODOLSKI," Sometimes, boys just need to be boys."
JAKE," You do realize he did thousands of dollars worth of property damage, though, to police vehicles."
PODOLSKI," Look, I think we can all agree that I’m ordering you to let this slide because nothing happened. This is officially out of your hands."
JAKE," Would you actually mind just checking out my report? It’s pretty thorough, and I spent over an hour on fonts. Kinda snazzy, so…"
PODOLSKI," Oh, thank you. I’ll get right to it."
JAKE, Thanks.
PODOLSKI," Trevor, let’s go."
JAKE, Have a good one.
CHARLES, Choo. Yes.
ROSA, What’s up with the chair?
CHARLES," Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I’d get badly hurt, so I’m not chancing it. Oh, man. There’s no more pudding cups left."
CHARLES, Ah! What’d you do that for?
ROSA," There. Now you’re hurt in this chair. You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle. And if you do, it won’t be because some shoe salesman predicted it. You make your own destiny."
JAKE," Well, we don’t have to worry about Podolski’s son anymore. The case is officially out of my hands. No charges filed."
HOLT, Why is there yogurt on this?
JAKE," The Deputy Commissioner threw my report in Terry’s trash can, and he’d been eating yogurt earlier."
HOLT, Terry loves yogurt.  Something wrong?
JAKE," Kinda, yeah. I called six precincts about this kid. He’s been brought in a dozen times. Theft, vandalism, drunken disorderly, but he’s never been processed. His daddy comes in and bails him out every time. He’s a lucky little jerk."
HOLT," No, I wouldn’t say he was lucky. I feel bad for this kid. I mean, what kind of father cares so little for his son that he lets him get away with everything? Well, he’s someone else’s problem now. Like you said, it’s out of your hands."
JAKE," Alright, I see what you’re trying to do, but it’s not gonna work. I’m not going to arrest him. I’m going to arrest him!"
HOLT, You want backup?
JAKE, Yes.
PODOLSKI, What is this? You can’t do this. Get that thing out of here.
JAKE," Excuse me, sir. Trevor Podolski, you’re under arrest for vandalism and destruction of property."
TREVOR, What--Dad!
PODOLSKI," What are you doing? I told you to back off, Peralta."
JAKE," First off, the name’s Santiago, Detective Amy Santiago. Second, I’m arresting your son, which, as I say it aloud, seems like an unwise choice, but it’s the one I’m making. Once again, my name is Amy Santiago."
PODOLSKI," You’re being stupid, Peralta. Don’t be stupid. I can make your life miserable."
HOLT," Commissioner, please don’t talk to my detective in that tone. If you have a complaint, you can take it up with me."
PODOLSKI," You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, Holt. I’m gonna be watching you, both of you, like a hawk."
HOLT," You’re gonna have to try a little harder if you wanna scare me. I’ve been an openly gay cop since 1987, so you’re not the first superior officer to threaten me. You know how I’m still standing here? ‘Cause I do my job, and I do it right. [walks back to police car]"
JAKE," Damn, son!"
HOLT, Don’t say “son.”
JAKE," Sorry. Deputy Commissioner, if you wanna pick Trevor up, he’ll be at the Nine-Nine. [walks back to police car] Let’s go, Fartman."
CHARLES," Carlene was wrong, Gina. Rosa said it herself-- I’m in charge of my own destiny. That means she wants me to make a move."
GINA," Mm, but Carlene was also right. You did get hurt ‘cause Rosa punched you. And the fact that Rosa punched you means she does not like you."
CHARLES," No, no, she punched me to prove Carlene wrong."
ROSA, Move.
GINA," Oh, wait, I take it back. She definitely is into you. So much chemistry."
CHARLES," I know, it’s crazy."
HOLT," Alright, let’s get this meeting started."
JAKE, I’m not late. I’m here. Right on time.
HOLT," You’re out of uniform, Peralta."
JAKE," Baby steps, Captain. Baby steps."
Amy," For the last time, the best cop movies, in order: Training Day, Lethal Weapon, and Fargo. End of discussion."
Jake, Wrong. Die Hard is the best cop movie of all time. One cop heroically saving the day while everyone else stands around and watches. It's the story of my life.
Charles," I like Turner & Hooch. Tom Hanks, reluctant friendship with a dog. That hits me where I live."
Rosa, No. Robocop. It's got everything I like--gratuitous violence.
Jake," Oh, I thought you were listing things."
Rosa, I was. I'm done.
Jake, Okay.
Gina," Let's talk Bad Boys. That's the perfect cop movie. Mr. Smith, lookin' fine. A hot cup of tea leone. Come on."
Terry, Francois Truffaut's Breathless. What? Terry likes foreign films.
Jake," Mm-kay. There is a correct answer to this question, though. So gather around for the greatest cop film of all time. Please refrain from texting during our presentation. [clicks something on his computer and video feed pops up] All right, so there's Hitchcock. And there's an old hooker. There it is!"
Hitchcock," Come on, guys, that happened four years ago."
Jake," Shh, this is the best part. She comes back, takes the wallet and here she goes!"
Jake," Hey, love the sweater. Who you slayin' tonight, lady killer?"
Charles," Well, we shall see what we shall see."
Jake," No, you're dressed exactly like The Lady Killer."
Charles, Damn it! This is Jeffrey Dahmer's corduroys all over again.
Terry," All right, let's get started. Scully. Where are you on digitizing the old case files?"
Scully," As of yesterday, I'm officially 1% done. "
Terry, Why are you smiling? That's nothin'.
Scully," There's thousands of cases, and for each one, I have to fill out 200 little box thingies on 50 different screens."
Rosa, At least you get to sit on your butt all day.
Scully, That's actually the worst part. My doctor said I have an anal canyon.
Jake," Ugh, god, Scully. Why are you always telling us about your disgusting body?"
Jake, I don't see anything.
Scully, That's because it's all wart.
Jake, How are you married?
Holt," Peralta, where are we on the Adams Street burglary?"
Jake," We are very close, Captain. Aside from a complete absence of evidence, suspects, or leads. So, in conclusion, not at all close."
Holt, And the Vickers Street aggravated assault?
Jake," Stalled out, and the Calloway robbery also remains unsolved.. Due to a lack of solving it by me."
Gina, Sounds like someone's in a little bit of a slump.
Jake, I'm not in a slump.
Amy, You're not? Scoreboard.
Jake," I don't slump, people. I opposite slump. I p-muls. That's ""slump"" backwards, and it's what I do. I p-muls all over this bitch."
Terry, Dismissed.
Amy, Slump.
Jake, P-muls!
Jake," Wait...Before you say anything, I want to guess what happened, based on your face. Someone died. No! You won a prize! I'm not getting better at this."
Holt, I'm concerned that the open cases mound of garbage on your desk has become so much higher than the closed cases mound of garbage.
Jake," All right, sir. Let me hit you with a little analogy. Are you familiar with racecars?"
Holt, Formula 1 or Stock?
Jake," That's already way more than I know about it. The point is, I'm a super-awesome race car who's hit a couple of unlucky speed bumps."
Holt, You got speed bumps on a race track?
Jake," Is that not part of car racing? It should be. All I'm saying is, it's open road again. I'm about to close a case. Missing grandma Helen Sterrino. Last Sunday, her grandson Judd reported she went out for bagels and never came back. [hands report to Holt] This morning, we picked up an old lady matching her description exactly. I showed her pictures of Judd, and she said, and I quote, [imitating old lady] 'That's my grandson.'"
Holt, What did I say about doing voices?
Jake," I'm a storyteller, sir. It's my craft. Anyways, grandson's coming in. They reunite, and I throw another case on the old ""Solved it"" pile. [puts file on a stack of other files and it falls off his desk] Hey my croissant. [picks up croissant that was under the stacks of papers then bangs it on the desk, showing it's rock solid, and proceeds to eat it]"
Amy," You wanted to see me, Captain?"
Holt," Yes, the D. A. wanted me to personally thank you for your work on the Jay Street drug bust."
Amy," That's why we do this, sir."
Holt, For praise?
Amy, Uh...
Holt, There's a community outreach program that's very important to me. I was wondering if you'd like to head it up.
Amy," Absolutely, sir. I won't just head it up, I will head and shoulders it up. I will dive in, swim around it, and just be altogether good with it."
Holt, Be more articulate when you speak to the children.
Amy," Yes, sir, I will make better mouth."
Charles," Hey, Sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup. Will you be Scary Terry?"
Terry," Oh, I love being Scary Terry. He says what regular Terry's thinking."
Terry, This is takin' too long! I'm gonna miss the farmer's market!
Terry," But I'm too busy. I've got a special case I'm working on. Uh, Hitchcock, Boyle needs you to fill out a lineup."
Hitchcock," Oh, great. I'll take my shirt off."
Charles, No one asked you to take your shirt off. Stop volunteering to take your shirt off.
Hitchcock, I can't hear you! Shirt's over my ears.
Amy," Hi, Rosa. Ooh, I like your shoes. They're a really pretty--"
Rosa, What do you need?
Amy," --Color. Okay. You know how, every year, the precinct does that junior police program seminar?"
Rosa, That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches?
Amy," No, the thing where we try to get at-risk kids--"
Rosa, Losers.
Amy, To sign up to become junior police officers.
Rosa, Snitches. What about it?
Amy, Captain specifically asked me to run it this year. I signed you up to do it with me. Here's the info. [handing packet to Rosa]
Rosa, Now I gotta read something?
Gina, Greetings. Fine. I guess I can help you with those at-risk kids.
Amy," I don't need your help. It's nothing personal. It's just... You're not a cop, so I'm not really sure you could help."
Gina, Okay. No hard feelings. But I hate you. Not joking. Bye.
Jake," Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Terrino. I'm glad you're here. May I present to you... [imitates trumpet fanfare while showing the family the old lady]"
Old lady," Oh, my darlings. Thank god I found you. Oh, look at those beautiful cheeks."
Jake," What? No, she recognized you. This is Helen."
Old Lady, Who's Helen? Oh! That's my husband. Solomon. 
Charles, I'm--I'm not really her husband.
Old Lady, You're so much shorter than you used to be. What did the Japanese do to you?
Jake, Different generation.
Charles," Okay, this is Ethel Musterberg from the Prospect Heights Senior Center. There was an I.D. card in her back pocket."
Terry, Why was your hand in her back pocket?
Jake," Well, she told me she didn't have any I.D., and unlike Boyle, my first instinct was not to caress her butt."
Charles, Frisked! I frisked her butt!
Holt," It looks like this case remains unsolved, Peralta."
Jake," Oh, my god. I'm in a slump!"
Jake," Oh, cool. You're all here in the break room."
Rosa, You asked us to come in here.
Jake," What? Here's a hypothetical question. Let's say I knew someone that, for the first time in their career, was experiencing, like, a minor slump. What do you think you would suggest to that person if they were going through that?"
Charles," Well, I haven't really been in a slump since my divorce. So I'd tell this person, ""Maybe get divorced."" He'd have to get married first."
Jake," Okay, so the suggestion to beat is get married and then divorced. Rosa?"
Rosa," Fly to Montreal, hit a classy hotel bar, bone a stranger, slump over."
Jake," Wow, that sounds amazing."
Rosa, Yeah.
Jake," That's a good one. Sarge, what would you do?"
Terry," 10,000 sit-ups."
Jake," Okay, do you have a backup plan in case my hypothetical person can only do 9,500, or 3?"
Holt, What's going on in here?
Charles, We're helping Jake's friend get out of his slump.
Holt," Or try working a case until it's solved, Peralta. I always find that closing cases is the best way to end the slump."
Jake," Thank you, Captain!"
Terry," He's right. You just need a win. Pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done."
Jake, Fine! Right after I do Rosa's Montreal sex thing. That sounds fun.
Rosa, Yeah.
Amy," Okay, this is the Junior Police Program. AKA ""Mission Possible."" [clicks something and the TV starts playing spy music] Your mission, should you choose to accept it, [pointing at the kids as she walks back and forth] is to get your life back on track."
Gina, Narc!
Amy," Hey, Gina. What are you doing?"
Gina," Oh, hi, Amy. Since I have nothing to offer, and since I'm not a cop, I thought I'd just show up and learn."
Amy, Do you wanna help me out here?
Rosa," Nah, I think I'm good."
Amy," I know you think getting in trouble is cool. But let me show you what can happen if you continue down this path. [using a different voice] Hey, yo, I'm an at-risk kid, and I think it's cool to sell drugs."
Kid, Hold up--Why does the kid selling drugs sound like he's black?
Amy, He's not.
Gina," Well, why not? Are you saying that black people can't sell drugs?"
Amy," No, I'm not saying that."
Kid, We have a black president. Why can't black people sell drugs?
Amy, I'm so confused.
Gina, Black people can sell drugs!
Terry, Don't make me hit you again.
Terry, Um...I'm building this dollhouse for my girls. It's their birthday tomorrow. I told my wife I'd get it done.
Charles, I had the same exact one when I was a kid!
Little Girl," Mom, Charles is hogging my doll house!"
Kid Charles, Grandma bought it for the both of us!
Charles," You want some help, big man?"
Terry," No! I can do this. It's just driving me a little crazy. Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?! Where do I affix it?!"
Charles, On the side of the turret--
Terry," Not now, Boyle. Let a brother breathe. Let a brother breathe."
Hitchcock, Why would I swap cases with you? I got multiple calls that a guy in the Sackett Towers is dealing meth out of his apartment. It's a guaranteed arrest.
Jake," And therefore will have a ton of paperwork. Which I know you hate. I have a murder here with no leads and no evidence. It's unsolvable, and thus... shall have no paperwork."
Hitchcock," You had me at ""No paperwork."""
Jake," That was the very end of the sentence. All right, Boyle. Let's hit it."
Holt," So, where are you going, Peralta?"
Jake," I am on my way to ending the slump. I got a dunker, Captain. Nothin' but net."
Charles," Hey, slump, you're about to get nailed by the Jake Hammer."
Holt," So you haven't solved any of your old cases, and yet you've taken on a new one. I mean, shouldn't you at least solve this Helen Sterrino missing grandmother case first?"
Jake," Or I could solve a super easy one, get my mojo back, and move on to catching The Zodiac Killer. Am I getting ahead of myself?"
Charles," No, you are not, Jake Rabbit."
Jake, I like Jake Hammer better. Let's go. Ah.
Amy, I did not think getting these kids to sign up would be this hard.
Rosa, [scoffs] These kids don't wanna listen to you. You're like... Smart and articulate.
Amy, So are you! Why am I offended by that?
Rosa," They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets. I am. Follow, watch, learn. All right, listen up. [rips earbuds out of two girls ears] I know you think you're badasses. But deep down, you're scared. How do I know? Because I've been that same scared kid, and if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail. Got it?"
Kid," Remix, yo! "
Rosa, What's happening?
Amy, I think they're laughing at you.
Rosa, That's never happened before. I don't like it.
Jake," NYPD, hands where I can see them."
Old Man," Don't shoot! I was just practicing my minuets, but I'll hold it down."
Jake," All right, flute man, who else is in this apartment? Where's the dealer?"
Flute Man, I live here alone with my birds.
Jake," What, you don't think I know this M.O.? These are mules. They're drug mules. They're bird mule drugs. Drug bird mules."
Charles, Apartment's clear.
Jake, We got multiple calls about a dealer here.
Flute Man," I bet it's the silly kids down the hall. They love prank calling me. The only drugs in this apartment are for my heart, my liver, my kidney, my salivary glands, and my penis and my feet."
Charles," Oh, bird pooped on your shoulder. No, wait... Pooped on your head, then dripped onto your shoulder."
Charles," I'm telling you, it's good luck."
Jake," No, it isn't, okay? That's just something people say when a bird poops on you to make you feel better because it's terrible."
Hitchcock," Fore, comin' in!"
Jake," Oh, come on."
Hitchcock," I was at the crime scene. This guy comes up out of nowhere, confesses. Well, he says he's gotta make things right, so helps me track down his accomplices."
Jake," That is so great, man. Looks like everything's comin' up Hitchcock."
Gina," Hey, Jake. You busy?"
Jake," Yes, I very clearly am busy."
Gina, The medical examiner's office just called. They mishandled some evidence. So the D.A.'s gonna have to dismiss your last two busts.
Jake, Great. And the slump gets worse.
Gina," I don't think it's a slump. Honestly, you are straight-up cursed."
Jake," Good to know. Can you hand me a paper towel, please, Gina?"
Gina, There's no more left.
Jake," Yeah, that sounds right."
Jake, Hey.
Holt, You're dripping on my carpet.
Jake," Oh, don't worry, sir. It's just urinal water. Clean urinal water."
Charles, You could eat off his shirt.
Holt, Why would I ever eat off his shirt?
Jake," Look, sir, I don't know what's going on, but I think I'm cursed."
Holt," Cursed, huh?"
Jake," The freakiest things have been happening to me. I mean, I can't solve a case to save my life. Birds are unloading on me left and right. And, two seconds ago..."
Jake," Hey, Sarge, do we have any old t-shirts in here? I-- "
Jake, Cursed.
Holt," Yeah, I've seen this kind of thing before. It happened to a friend of mine back in the 1-8. Detective Smith. We called him Smitty. He thought he was cursed, and because cops are superstitious, the whole precinct thought he was cursed."
Jake," But then he found a case, and he solved it. And now he's married to Kate Upton."
Holt," No. No one would go out on calls with him. He responded to a riot at a gym without backup, and got beaten up by a girls' volleyball team. It was actually quite violent."
Charles, Man... Girls are so scary.
Holt," I don't want you out in the field again, Peralta. I'm pulling you from casework. You can digitize old files with Scully."
Jake," You're benching me? No, no, no, look-- I've got a plan. Give all my open cases to Hitchcock, who's suddenly on a roll, and assign me 20 fresh ones. Eventually, my luck will turn."
Holt," No, I don't think that's what's best for you or the squad. Not until this blows over."
Jake, And how long will that be?
Holt," Could be a week, could be a month."
Charles," Could be a year. Could be a decade. Sorry, we're just saying bigger and bigger numbers."
Amy," I don't know how to connect with these kids. They're mean and shallow and respect nothing. I mean, what kind of person would they even listen to?"
Gina," Hitchcock, stop bringing your food in little tupperware containers. It hurts my fingers when I'm trying to open it."
Hitchcock, Sorry!
Amy," Hey, Gina. That's a super cute--"
Gina, What do you want?
Amy, --Sweater. Okay. Rosa and I think it would be great if you talked to the kids.
Gina," Mm, I thought only cops could help."
Rosa," In this case, not being a cop might actually be better."
Gina," Mm, that's true. In all cases, cops are the worst."
Jake," ""Enter the numbers from this report into the corresponding boxes on the screen. Then fill out these fields."" And I'm in a coma. Hey, Hitchcock. Help me out, man. I'm so bored. Let me jump back on that murder with you."
Hitchcock, No. I got it.
Jake," Come on, man, let me just--"
Hitchcock," No, don't touch it! You're contagious. Everything could fall apart!"
Holt," Peralta, leave Hitchcock alone! Come here. I got in touch with Smitty. He says that you should rub this rabbit's foot with your left forefinger and your pinky, like this, for good luck. Okay? Now you try it."
Jake," Okay. Yep. It's definitely helping. I can feel it. The curse is lifting off of me. Ah, hand cramp!"
Holt," Rub, rub, rub."
Charles, You okay?
Terry, The fairy princess castle has defeated me. I'm a grown man with man hands and a man brain. I should be able to put together a dollhouse in less than four hours. Why does it have to be so hard? Look... This screw has three point sides. And nowhere to screw it in! [screw clatters to floor] And there's wheels. What kind of castle has wheels? [screams as he starts destroying what's left of the castle]
Jake," 117A. Yes. 117B. Yes. 118A. Wait a minute. Hey, just heading to the can."
Holt, Take the rabbit's foot.
Jake, Roger that.
Charles, Hey. What's going on?
Jake," Well, I'm not allowed to leave my desk, so we have to meet in here."
Charles, So what you're saying is that this is kind of a...
Jake," No, for the last time, Charles, we don't need a clubhouse."
Charles, You know what I'm thinking?
Jake, No clubhouse.
Jake," I need you to make these calls for me. Don't let Holt see you. But if my hunch is right, the slump is over. Come through for me, Boyle."
Charles, You know I will.
Jake, All right.
Charles," I'm just saying, put a couple leather chairs in here."
Jake, Go!
Gina," Children, your problem is not that you're troubled or at-risk or bad dressers. Is that a trucker hat? Still? Come on. Your problem... is that you don't have passion for anything. My life turned around when I found my passion. And today, well I hope to inspire you with it. [clicks to turn on Christina Aguilera's Beautiful and she starts dancing, after a while she shuts off the music and sits on the table] What are we thinking? Yes, in the denim."
Gina," Fine. Cops make $52,000 a year. You never have to stop at a red light. And you get to carry a gun. Who wants in? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Yes."
Amy," Oh, my god. You got eight kids to sign up. How did you know that would work?"
Gina, That's what made me sign up when I was a kid.
Rosa, You did this program?
Gina, Mm-hmm. Yeah. It does not work.
Charles, They're here.
Jake, Fantastic. Too dramatic?
Charles, No.
Jake, Hi.
Jake," I thought you might ask that, and I will answer in due time. But first, I know what happened to your grandma. Nothing."
Jake," The reason I couldn't find her is because she never existed. I had Detective Boyle make some calls, and it turns out you've done this before. Five missing persons reports in five different states. [hands Mr. Terrino the reports] Recognize this?"
Jake," Probably insurance fraud. Definitely filing a false report and obstruction of justice. Now, you were wondering why we did this in the bathroom. It's because you're full of crap."
Charles, Blammo! Jake Hammer strikes again.
Jake, Jake Hammer strikes again.
Holt, Detectives. I see we got eight recruits for the Junior Police Program. Outstanding.
Amy," Thank you, sir. But, as important as your praise is to me, it should actually go to Gina. She's the one that got through to the kids."
Gina," Yes, I am amazing. And I only ask for one thing in repayment. A 600% raise."
Holt," Or... I can give you a zero percent raise and make you my personal assistant, which is what I'm doing. I think you have hidden talents, which will make you surprisingly good at the job."
Gina," No, I have no talents."
Holt, You start Monday.
Gina, Ugh. Constantly getting Holt's approval is the worst.
Amy," Yes, I can only imagine."
Jake," Well, the curse is over. The slump is done. Jake is back. Permission to take a selfie of the two of us, sir? [holds out phone in front of both their faces]"
Holt, Permission denied.
Jake," Too late. Ah, that was a good one."
Holt," So, the rabbit's foot worked, huh?"
Jake," Ah, maybe. All I know is my mind was so numb from doing all that boring data entry that my brain kind of rebooted, and I had an inspiration about one of my old cases. [deep breath] And I now see that that was your plan all along. And that you're capable of smiling."
Holt," All talented detectives haves their ups and downs, Peralta."
Jake, So you think I'm talented. You said it. No takebacks.
Holt, You know why Boyle doesn't slump?
Jake, Because his whole life is a slump?
Holt," Because he doesn't let adversity get him down. He keeps grinding. If I'd given you those new cases, the second you hit a snag, you would have spiraled again. You need to stay out of your own head."
Jake," Okay. But, sir, I don't get it. If that was your plan, why bother with Smitty and the rabbit's foot?"
Holt," Well, there's a very good reason for that. I was, uh, I believe the term is, uh... messing with you."
Jake," Oh... I see what's going on here. We're becoming homies. Office Christmas card candidate, right here! Me and Holt are homies!"
Charles," Hey, Sarge. I assembled the castle for you. Here it is."
Terry," Oh, my god. What happened to all the princess flourishes?"
Charles," Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station. You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers. Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?"
Terry," Thank you, Boyle. I appreciate it."
Charles," You're a good dad. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Oh, check this out. Working siren. [flicks a switch and a siren starts blaring] I'll fix that!"
AMY, I'm so glad we could finally do this.
Date," I know, Kylie says you're always stuck at the precinct."
AMY," Yeah. Speaking of, this is work. Sorry. What's up, Peralta?"
Jake, Captain called. He needs everybody back. There's a lead on the nightingale strangler.
AMY, Okay.
Jake," His M.O. is he finds lonely women with no friends, poisons their food, and then guts 'em in his van. It's pretty gnarly. Last seen wearing a salmon shirt, grey blazer, and witnesses have said he has trouble fitting lettuce in his mouth."
Amy, Okay. Where are you?
Jake," Apparently has the world's smallest pen1s and doesn't know how to use it... Hi, there, I'm Jake Peralta, Amy's boss. That's not true."
Amy, What are you doing here?
Jake, I'm here on a date. Who is now leaving. Worth it. Have a great night.
Date, Your boss seems really nice.
Amy, He's not my boss.
Jake," Yes, I am!"
Jake," And with a record five felonies solved in one week, Peralta pulls ahead. Did you guys hear that I solved five felonies in a week?"
Amy, We heard.
Jake, Really? How?
Jake," Five felonies in one week! Light 'em up, Boyle."
Jake, That's the sweet taste of triumph.
Rosa, You should shower more.
Jake, Yep.
Terry, Updates on open cases.
Charles, I just got a DOA on Bessimer street.
Terry," You're the primary, you're in charge. Take Diaz and Peralta."
Boyle, Yes. My fantasy threesome. Of cops on a case.
Captain Holt," Detectives, our monthly crime statistics are due. I want all paperwork on your closed cases by tomorrow. Scully, you can just write ""I didn't close any"" on a piece of paper."
Scully, You got it.
Amy," I already got my paperwork in, Captain."
Captain Holt, Then I guess this little reminder isn't for you.
Jake," Wow, looks like he hates you even more than me."
Amy," No, he doesn't. We have a good relationship. We're on the same page."
Holt," Something to share with the rest of us, Santiago?"
Amy," No, sir, I wasn't... Peralta was the one that was talking. God, you must have been the worst fourth grader ever."
Holt, Joke's on you. I skipped fourth grade.
Holt," Santiago, anything else?"
Santiago, No.
Holt, No?
Amy, Uh-uh.
Holt, Dismissed.
Amy," Hey, Boyle. I know you haven't had Peralta as a secondary in a while. Be careful. It can be rough."
Jake," Hey, saboteur, that's not true."
Jake, I happen to be a very good secondary.
Amy, So you were just borrowing those cars?
Peralta, Ask about his bank account. Ask about his bank account! Ask him about his bank...
Peralta breaks the glass of the interrogation room Jake," Account. You should ask him about his bank account. Captain, Santiago broke the glass."
Amy," You can't give up control, you're terrible at taking your primary's orders, you just do whatever you want. I could go on and on and on."
Jake, Is something no lover of yours has ever said.
Boyle, Blammo.
Jake," Look, I can be an amazing secondary and I'll prove it."
Charles," I know you will, Jake-in-the-box."
Jake," Okay, don't ever call me that again. I'm driving. We should leave now. Carry my bag. But you should pick the music, primary."
Amy," It's a great picture, sir."
Holt, I hate it.
Amy," Me too. So I have an eyewitness in the purse-snatcher case. Only problem is, the sketch artist is out sick. How do you want me to proceed?"
Holt," Figure it out, Santiago. It's your case."
Amy, Yes. I will do that. Thank you.
Holt, Are you bowing?
Amy, No. This is how I walk.
Rosa," What do you need, Quasimodo? I gotta go meet with Boyle and Peralta."
Amy, Is there something wrong with the Captain? It seems like he's in a bad mood.
Rosa, I don't know. Who can tell?
Rosa," You all right, Captain? Tough weekend?"
Holt, I went to Barbados with my husband. We wove hats out of Palm fronds and swam with the stingrays. I've never been happier.
Rosa, Guy's impossible to read. Don't even try.
Holt on the phone," That is, without question, the funniest story I've ever heard."
Jake, Wow. This guy must have weighed 500 pounds. I think we have an idea what killed him. Spoiler alert: It was not starvation.
Jake," Sorry, sorry. You're the primary, you're in charge."
Officer," Frank Patterson. 58 years old, married, no children. Wife found him this morning and called it in."
Charles, Any signs of forced entry or a struggle?
Officer, No.
Jake, You sure about that? Looks like maybe his belt had a pretty epic struggle with his stomach.
Rosa,"What are you thinking, Boyle?"
Charles, All ri...
Jake," I'm calling natural causes. We got heart medicine over here, home defibrillator. And a frequent customer gift basket from the cardiac wing of Brooklyn Methodist. This case is open and shut. Just like his mouth was, constantly. That was my last fat joke. Okay? Diaz, check and see if there's any more meds in the bathroom. Boyle, see what you can find in the bedroom. I'll take the kitchen."
Charles," Yep, that's exactly what I was gonna say. It's... it's so weird. He's so good at knowing what I'm gonna tell him to do, he just does it. It's weird."
Amy," Hey, sergeant. You know how you're really good at doodling?"
Terry," I know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult. You a big fan of Picasso's doodles?"
Amy, Sorry. Can you please draw a perp for me? The sketch artist is out sick and the Captain wants this done right away. He's in a bad mood.
Terry, Is he? I can never read him.
TERRY," You look chipper, Captain. You have a fun weekend?"
Holt, There was a small fire in my home. I lost many photo albums of treasured memories. I'm devastated.
Amy," I'm telling you, he and I have a connection and there is something bothering him. Can you help me out?"
Amy," Great. Ma'am, can you please describe the perp to sergeant Jeffords?"
Lady," Yeah, he had, um, dark, curly hair, and a neck tattoo..."
Terry," Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Let's start with the eyes. Were they desperate? Lonely? Did they betray heartache?"
Lady, They were brown.
Terry, Do you even want your purse back?
Rosa, So far you've managed to tell three fat jokes and completely bulldoze Charles. Is that your idea of being a good secondary?
Jake," First off, I've told four. And second, I'm helping. I mean, I started cataloguing the contents of the fridge, but it turns out there's not enough paper on earth. Five fat jokes. Thanks, Arnie. [Laughs] See, Arnie thinks I'm doing great."
Rosa," Arnie, shut up. Jake, for once, just hang back and let Boyle do his job."
Jake," Fine. Unless I get a direct order from Boyle I will stand here motionless like a wise, old oak tree."
Rosa, You look like an idiot.
Charles," I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Patterson. Can you talk about what happened after breakfast?"
Charles, I'm sure the soft drink industry mourns his passing.
Jake, Motion reactivated. Hey. Detective Jake Peralta.
Jake," Actually, I've been given a direct order to do nothing, so. What brings you here... Okay. All right. Sorry. Sorry."
Jake, What's up?
Holt, How's the Patterson case looking?
Boyle," It looks like natural causes, but I'll know for sure once I get the autopsy results tomorrow. Jake volunteered to follow up with the M.E. My man is all over it."
Jake," Well, it's technically not really my case, but on the plus side, I have all the time in the world."
Rossi, Oh.
Jake," To you. And to the ginormous, dead fat man who brought us together."
Boyle," Hey, Jake. Have you heard anything from the M.E.? She hasn't sent the autopsy report."
Jake," Oh, that's strange. Maybe probably a bunch more people died and she got super busy? That's definitely what happened."
Charles," Okay, just let me know when she calls. You got it."
Jake," Hey, can I ask you guys something? Can you keep a secret?"
Rosa, Do you know anything about my life?
Jake," No, I do not. Good point. Okay, so you know the new medical examiner? I kinda had s*x with her last night."
Amy, What?
Jake," Oh, sorry, I forgot who I was talking to. s*x is something that two adults do with their bodies when they're attracted to each other."
Rosa," He's right, Santiago. Do you not know that?"
Amy," I meant, what were you thinking? She was supposed to be doing an autopsy for your primary, Charles."
Jake," The guy died of natural causes. What's the big deal? Anyways, back to last night. As you would imagine, I'm normally up for pretty much anything in the bedroom, but I can't tell if what happened was weird or sexy."
Rossi, Wait. Close your eyes.
Jake," Oh, okay."
Rossi," Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
Jake, What are you doing?
Rossi, rI like 'em cold.
Jake, Okay...
Rosa, Not that weird.
Jake, Cold? Like a dead guy?
Amy, You're reading into that.
Jake, Am I?
Rossi, You have a really nice chest.
Jake, Thank you.
Rossi, I'd love to crack it open and get my hands all over your organs.
Jake, Okay...
Rossi, I wonder how much your appendix weighs. [Gasps] Oh. It's inflamed.
Jake," All right. Wait, that's bad, right?"
Rossi," Yeah, it is. Oh, no."
Amy, Ew! Please tell me you ran out of there.
Jake, No. For some reason I kinda started getting into it.
Rossi," Oh, what do we have here?"
Jake laying on the floor, A 34-year-old caucasian male who is dead. Very dead.
Rossi, Mmm. Cause of death?
Jake, Initial assessment: Blunt force trauma.
Rossi, But what do I find when I probe a little farther?
Jake, Bruising around the neck. And ocean water in the lungs.
Rossi," Ooh, how long have you been dead, body?"
Jake, Four days.
Rossi, Gross. Bloating. Odors.
Jake," Oh, uh, 24 hours."
Rossi, Perfect.
Jake, Here we go.
Amy," Stop, stop, stop! Weird, weird, weird!"
Jake," Rosa, what's your call? Weird or sexy?"
Rosa, Weird.
Jake, I knew it. But also kinda sexy?
Rosa," No. Weird. But more importantly, that's what you were doing while Charles was grinding through paperwork?"
Amy," Told ya. Worst secondary in the unit. What do you guys want from me? You know, I take over a crime scene, I'm a bad secondary. I blow off work to have s*x with a hot coroner, I'm a bad secondary. I can't win."
Charles, What are you guys talking about?
Jake," Um, just weird s*x stuff that has nothing to do with work."
Charles, I once had s*x on a futon. And it was in couch mode.
Jake, Hmm.
Amy," Sarge, all of these are fine. How much longer are you gonna work on this?"
Terry, It's questions like that that made Van Gogh cut off his ear. You can't put a clock on art. Ten minutes.
Amy, Great. Let's catch this guy so we can give Holt some good news. I wanna cheer him up.
Scully," Well, how do you even know he's in a bad mood? I mean, it's impossible to read that guy."
Holt," This is the most incompetent, worthless report I have ever read in my life! Get your act together or, so help me God, you won't live to see retirement!"
Scully," It's like, ""what's that guy thinking?"" You know?"
Amy," I can read him. And if anyone can figure out what's bothering him, it's me. He and I are exactly the same. Except that I'm younger, Cuban, female, single, and straight."
Terry, Captain Holt's not gay. Captain Holt's gay?
Amy," Seriously, man, just retire."
Holt," Boyle, where's my paperwork on that DOA? Still waiting on the autopsy report. Supposed to come in first thing this morning, but so far, nothing."
Holt, This is unacceptable. I'll call the M.E. and find out what happened.
Jake," Eh, bup-bup-bup-bup-bah. That's not necessary, sir. For the record, I think it's natural causes anyway, but I'm also the secondary in this case. It's my responsibility, so I will head on down there and pick up the report."
Holt, Good. But don't ever bup-bup-bup-bup me again.
Jake," Right, I don't know..."
Holt, Bup-bup-bup-bup... Bup-bup-bup. Just go.
Jake," Yep, I am going to regret teaching him that one."
Boyle," Rosa, can I show you something? What's up? Patterson's wife told me that they were going on a cruise together next month, but her credit card bill shows only one ticket booked. Either she's lying or she knew he was gonna die."
Rosa," Huh, nice find, Boyle."
Boyle, This could be a murder. Where's that autopsy? Jake went down to the M.E. an hour and a half ago. He still hasn't got back to me.
Rosa, Jake went to get the autopsy report?
Boyle," I know. Isn't he the best? I mean, he's really coming into his own as a secondary. I wanna get him something nice. Does he come across more as a Pinot guy or more of a Shiraz?"
Rosa, You know what? We better go down there. See what's holding him up.
Charles, Good call.
Rossi, Detectives. Hello.
Rosa, Shirt's buttoned wrong.
Boyle," Uh, we came by to get that autopsy report. Hmm. Is Detective Peralta here? I haven't seen him. Thanks for coming by."
Peralta, Rosa. Hold on. Found him.
Jake," Ah, thank goodness you're here. I am so lost. Do you know where the vending machines are?"
Jake," Look, it's not what it seems like. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Here's what happened. I came down here to get the autopsy report and in conclusion, here we are. Now if you'll excuse me..."
Rosa," Cut the crap, Peralta. Look, I'm sorry I slowed down the autopsy results, but everyone knows it's natural causes."
Boyle, Not anymore. We think it could be a murder.
Jake," Wait, like a murder murder, or, like, his mouth murdered him by making him eat so much food that his heart exploded?"
Rosa, Murder murder.
Rossi, We need the autopsy to be sure.
Rossi, I have not gotten to that yet.
Charles," You guys have been down here for two hours. What, did you have s*x 40 times?"
Jake," 40 times? No, Charles, like... Look, I'm sorry. We didn't know it was a homicide."
Charles," Well, it shouldn't matter. I'm your primary and I asked you to do something. So if it's okay, I'd like to be upset with you."
Rossi," Actually, with a body this size, I'd need my assistant, and I gave him the rest of the afternoon off when Jake showed up."
Jake," Guilty. Okay, fine. I will act as your assistant because I am a wonderful secondary. How gross could it be?"
Rossi, Just gonna need you to hold open this chest cavity for me.
Jake," Oh. Wow. Okay, I can do that. It's no big deal. Just like holding open some slimy elevator doors. For a family of aliens... Oh, my God."
Rossi," Yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising. Oh, will you look at that stomach lining? God, that is just a beaut."
Jake, Ugh.
Rossi, All right. I'm gonna need you to go ahead and take your hand...
Rossi," Yep, get it down there."
Rossi, Get it down there. Get it on in.
Rossi ," There you go. Oh, that is so big."
Holt, Caught him?
Amy," Yes, sir. He was easy to pick up. He looked just like the sergeant's sketch."
Scully," You could be a professional artist, boss. Like on the boardwalk."
Terry, You think I should draw caricatures? That's garbage art! I don't draw giant-head people on surfboards!
Scully, I'm saying you could. You're that good.
Amy," Captain, the credit really goes to sergeant Jeffords. Without his refined artistic skills..."
Holt, Finish the paperwork by noon. I want it included in the crime stats.
Perp," I gotta say, I always hate how I look in pictures, but that is so flattering. Also, I'm innocent."
Terry, Shut up.
Amy," Sarge, I need you to do one more drawing for me. What? It'll cheer the Captain up. He'll be over the moon. He may even lean back in his chair a little and nod slightly."
Terry," This is a lot of pressure. If I'm gonna do this, it has to be done right. Scully, get me my oils."
Scully, Paint or massage? I'll get both.
Rossi," You know, this is one of the most unhealthy people I've ever seen. It's like cutting into a big, overstuffed ravioli. Sure you want me to keep digging?"
Jake," Unfortunately, yes. If the primary on this case says it's a murder, we have to treat it like a murder."
Rossi, Okay. Here we go. Oh. Wanna see something cool?
Jake, No.
Rossi, Here it is. That's what I'm talking about. [Gasps] Listen. Goosh.
Jake, Mm-hmm.
Rossi," You know what that was? That was the air releasing from the large intestine. [Sighs] In the biz, we call that ""the death bubble."" It's pretty cool. Here, you wanna hold it?"
Jake leaves, No!
Amy, Knock knock.
Holt, You can knock with your hands. Saying it is ridiculous.
Amy," Okay. Well, I know you're having a bad day... I think you're having a bad day. So, to cheer you up I had Terry do this painting to replace the photo you hated."
Holt, I threw away the photo because I think it's ostentatious to hang pictures of yourself. Especially when you haven't earned a place on the wall.
Amy, Oh.
Holt," But you would have me hang a baroque oil painting of myself like I'm a north Korean dictator. What? No ornate gold frame? Why am I not astride my noble steed, clad in armor? We could add a horse. You just wasted your time, Terry's time, and now my time on this when you should have been filing a report on the purse-snatcher."
Amy," Oh, I did. It's already in the system."
Captain, Oh. Mm-hmm. Good. Thank you. Dismissed.
ROSSI," Here are the contents of his stomach. Oh, that's where they went. And here's the really cool part. Get in here, look at the scarring on this liver. Cause of death: Poison. Ingested."
Jake sighs," Boyle was right. All right, I'm gonna go tell him."
Rossi," Yeah, you could. Or you could stay for a post-mortem."
Jake," Nope. Sorry. The spell has worn off. No more weird dead guy s*x for me ever again. It's nothing personal, I just think s*x is for the living. Isn't that right, buddy? Oh, my God, he has no eyes! Oh, that is terrifying."
Amy," What now, Santiago?"
Amy, I figured out why you've been so tense. You're worried about the monthly crime statistics.
Holt, That's not your concern.
Amy, I just checked the stats myself. Our arrest numbers haven't improved since you got here. They're exactly the same as last month.
Captain Holt," If this is your strategy to cheer me up, it's backfiring."
Amy," Sir, I don't think you realize how good flat numbers are. I went back 12 years. A precinct's numbers almost always get worse under new leadership, but ours didn't. That's a win. It's just your first month. Morale is much higher, people are working harder, you're well on your way to earning a place on that wall."
Holt," Thank you, Santiago."
Amy," You know, we're birds of a feather, you and I."
Holt, I hate cliches.
Amy, Cliches are the worst. Okay.
Charles," We know you killed your husband. That cruise you planned was for one, plus the autopsy showed clear signs of poison."
Jake," And for the record, the inside of his body was very gross."
Charles," Noted. My only question is, why'd you do it?"
Mrs Patterson," Um, he drove me to it. He had affair after affair. He was a real don Juan."
Jake, Permission to make a fat joke?
Charles, Granted.
Jake," Are you sure you didn't mean ""don flan""? Thanks."
Charles," Nice. Mrs. Patterson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband."
Rosa," Sarge, that painting is tight."
Terry, It's terrible. The brushwork is sloppy. There's poor use of negative space. I'm a fraud.
Holt, Not at all. I'd like to take this home for my husband. He'll be glad you made me look so happy.
Terry, I was trying to make him look serious. I still can't read him.
Rosa, No one can.
Amy, I can. He likes it.
Diaz," Nice job, Boyle. You nailed it."
JAKE," Here. Of course he did. He's a great primary. And I'm sorry I was such a bad number two. I may, for the first time, have been a bit of a jerk, and I'm sorry."
Charles, What a wonderful moment.
Jake," I agree, it is a wonderful moment. What a wonderful moment. Rosa, do you agree?"
Rosa, It's all right. It's all right
Charles, Oh. D.A. wants to set bail for Patterson's wife. They need me to send them all the files.
Jake, I'm the secondary. I'll go back there and do the busy work. You guys stay here and keep celebrating.
Rosa, You sure you're not just sneaking off for more weird dead guy s*x?
Jake," We will never speak of that again. Never. Okay, bye."
Charles," God. Crazy day, huh?"
Rosa, I hate small talk. Let's drink in silence.
Charles, Perfect.
Charles," She was, actually. That's how I met her. Went to college with her grandson Marvin. Don't... don't knock it till you try it. She had a replacement hip with some serious torque. It was like having s*x with a transformer."
Jake, No. That is no one's fantasy.
Terry, Peralta... Where are we on the Lincoln place murder?
Jake," Well, like I told Captain Holt earlier this week, we are at the one-yard line. It's a football reference."
Terry," Yes, Jake. I played linebacker at Syracuse."
Boyle," Really? In High School, I played center field in the musical damn Yankees."
Jake," Yeah, you don't want to brag about that."
Holt," Peralta, you want to loop everyone in?"
Jake, Ehh...
Holt, That was not a request.
Jake," Fine.Get ready for some stuff on a screen. Meet Fred Gorman... Prominent citizen, lawyer, corpse. Now meet his wife, Ann Hoert. She did not take his last name, but I believe she did take his life."
Charles, Nice.
Jake," Thank you, Charles. Now, Hoert had means, motives, and opportunity. I just need to find the murder weapon. For some reason, the D.A. won't move forward with the arrest until we find the knife she used."
Holt, Is that reason that they want to win the case?
Jake, Yes.
Holt," Well, find it. The family's close to the mayor, and I'm catching heat from the higher-ups. I'm gonna ask you again. Do you need any resources or personnel?"
Jake," No, sir, I've got it."
Holt," Okay. Dismissed! Sergeant Jeffords, my office."
Gina, Uh-oh. He probably wants to talk to you about how your shirts aren't tight enough probably.
Amy," Okay, how can we help? What do you need?"
Jake," I need nothing. I'm about to solve this case, meet the mayor, and sell my life rights to Channing Tatum so he can play my less attractive brother in the ensuing film."
Rosa," Come on, Peralta, Holt said to use the whole team. We all want this solved."
Jake," I appreciate the offer, but I work best alone... Except when it comes to s*x. Actually, sometimes including s*x."
Amy, Will you just let us help?
Jake," Okay, fine. I will let one of you help me... Charles."
Charles, Yeah!
Jake, And I am choosing Charles because he's the least likely to steal my thunder.
Harley, I would never steal his thunder. I-I'd be afraid to borrow it. [Chuckles]
Holt," Terry, I'd like you to accompany me to a gun range."
Terry, You mean drive you there and wait outside... Far away from the guns.
Holt," I spent eight years in the public affairs office, so my tactical skills are a little rusty. I need some pointers."
Terry," Sir, I haven't fired a weapon since the incident."
Holt, The mannequin incident... I'm familiar.
Terry," Actually, there was an incident after that."
Holt, Another incident?
Terry, Screaming shooting the piñata.
Jake," You got to cool it, man. I'm gonna get some candy."
Terry," Sir, I may not be the man for the job."
Holt," You used to be the precinct's champion marksman. I only want to take pointers from the best. So I'll keep it low-key. We'll go after work to a private range. No cops, no pressure."
Gina," Blam! Blam, blam! Gun range."
Holt, I told Gina she could join us.
Terry," I want to get certified. There has been a ton of crime in my neighborhood, and the cops in my precinct are very bad."
Holt, You live in our precinct.
Gina," Yeah, I know."
Jake," I know we've gone over this before, but I have to ask you again. Is there anywhere you can think of in that hallway where a knife could be hidden?"
DOORMAN," Well, since I've already told you, like, three times, no, why don't I just record it? Then I don't have to say it again. The hallway, like all other hallways, does not have a secret knife-hiding place. All right, you want to hear it again? Idea for a novel... A mild-mannered doorman gets bitten on the pen1s by a radioactive spider and becomes the world's greatest lover."
Jake," No, don't stop it. I want to hear what happens."
Doorman," This is terrific. He saves the first lady, if you must know."
Jake, Sounds compelling.
Charles," Oh, boy."
Lady," Well, hello. I heard you guys were making the rounds again."
Charles," All right. This one's all you, tiger."
Boyle, Come on!
Jake," Police! Hey, ma'am."
Lady," Thank God! Here, hold this.  The lasagna's burning."
Jake, Okay.
Lady," Get the dog, but don't let it touch the baby!"
Jake, Oh. Okay. Peralta.
Rosa," Yo, I looked at the photos of your victim on your desk."
Charles, Is that Rosa? Tell her I said hi.
Rosa," The puncture wounds are similar to a case I had a while back. They aren't from a knife. I think it's something spiral, like a corkscrew."
Jake," Shh, shh, shh, shh."
Rosa, Don't shush me. I'm helping you.
Jake," No, no, I'm holding a baby. That was actually very helpful, thank you."
Rosa, Uh-oh. You better get back here. Now.
Vulture," Oh! Hello, Peralta."
Jake," No, no, no!"
Vulture," I don't know why you're so upset, man. I'm the one who had to come to this backwater stink hole. What's up, little man?"
Charles, What's up?
Vulture, Feeling sexy? Huh?
Charles," Yeah, I feel sexy."
Vulture," Yeah, you look sexy, man."
Charles, You know I do.
Vulture," Watch out for that door. Yo, how much you bench, seriously?"
Jake," Captain, please, please, pretty please do not let him take over my case."
Holt, Major crimes is stepping in. Nothing I can do. You're off the case.
Jake, I can't believe you're just rolling over and giving my murder away to The Vulture.
Charles, We call him The Vulture because he swoops in and solves cases that are almost solved and takes the credit for himself.
Holt," Yes, Boyle, I put that together from context. First of all, major crimes has jurisdiction over any and all cases they want to take. But more importantly, you're the one who insisted on working alone. I told you for weeks to use the squad, and you refused."
Jake," I used them. I mean, Rosa's the one who figured out the corkscrew. And Charles caught a dog."
Holt," Oh, congratulations, Detective Boyle. You should've involved him sooner. Turn over your files to Detective Pembroke."
Charles," Sir, call him The Vulture. Giving him a name makes him human."
Holt, Turn over the files.
Jake," Fine. But in protest, I'm walking over there extremely slowly. Thank you. God! This is so boring!"
Holt, For both of us.
Vulture," You know, before I solve this case, I'd like to thank you for doing all the super-easy work, you know, the real Nancy Drew-level stuff."
Jake," Oh, yeah? Did Nancy Drew solve a lot of murders?"
Charles," Yeah, she did... Murder on lce, Recipe for Murder. Nancy was a wonderful Detective. I wanted to be her when I grew up."
Jake," Thanks, Charles. That's helpful."
Vulture, Hey! Should we take odds on how fast I'll solve this case?
Jake, Nope.
Vulture," I mean, what was it with Diaz's last ""impossible"" extortion case? What was it, six hours?"
Rosa, That's because it was 98% solved.
Vulture, The last 2% is the hardest to get. That's why they leave it in the milk.
Jake, What?
Pembroke," Oh! Wow! Looking good, Santiago. You foxy ma."
Amy, Go rot in hell. This is your fault.
Vulture," Thanks, champ. Good effort. I got it from here. And, hey, you feel free to call me anytime you need me to come down here and help powder that big white ass of yours."
Jake,"  Well, that's the worst thing that's ever happened to me."
Jake,  I hate The Vulture so much!
Rosa," Me too. But he's kind of hot. What? You can hate people and still think they're hot. Case in point, Manuel Noriega."
Jake, You know what? I'm with you on this. Tonya Harding.
Rosa," Yeah, she's thick."
Jake, Right?
Jake, Mm-hmm.
Rosa, Sorry you got vultured. Happens to the best of us.
Rosa," On my count. One, two..."
Vulture, Three! I got it from here! Yeah! Get up! Get up! Turn around! [Laughing]
Amy, You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say...
Vulture," Can and will be used against you in a court of law. Thanks, guys, I got it from here. Let's go. Beat it!"
Barista, Skim white chocolate macchiato for Charles.
Charles, yes:
Vulture, I got it from here.
Charles, I used a gift card for that!
Jake," God, I just... I want to get back at him so bad! I wish I could throw his cell phone in the toilet or slash his tires... I don't know."
Rosa, Or slash his gorgeous throat.
Charles, I cannot figure you out.
Jake," Okay, I'm buying everyone drinks as long as we're here thinking of a revenge plan. Best idea gets 50 bucks. Throw 'em on out."
Charles," What if you called him from a hospital and said his whole family is dead? Like, they died of cancer."
Jake," Charles, that is so dark. I'm putting it down."
Holt," So my stance feels good, but I'm still not hitting center."
Terry, All right. Back your left foot up a hair.
Gina," Like this? Mm, mm, mm!"
Terry, No! Gina! We've been over this.
Gina," Well, show me! Like, wrap your thick, muscular arms around me and..."
Terry," All right, look, hands here, stand up straight, chin forward."
Gina moves the gun to scratch her nose," Hold on, my nose itches."
Terey, Gina!
Holt," When I lock my shooting arm, the other hand feels unstable. Now, what stance am I supposed to be doing... Weaver or isosceles?"
Gina," You guys did stances? Like, I'll be like..."
Terry," Hey, all right, all right! Look, hey, both you, just watch."
Gina, That's eight! He did it!
Holt, That was only seven.
Terry, Why are you counting my shots? Are you trying to have me recertified?
Holt," Yes. If you make eight of ten shots, I can sign off on you carrying a gun again. Gina's here as an official witness, and I thought it'd be easier for you in a no-pressure environment."
Terry, I can't believe you tricked me!
Holt," You're too good a cop to be shackled to a desk. You only have one hit until you get recertified. So deep breath, huh? Take the final shot."
Terry," Don't overthink it. Just relax and breathe. Bring air into your lungs... Like you've done your whole life. [Panting] Oh, my God. Guys! How do you breathe? I forgot how to breathe! Is it two in, one out?"
Charles, What if we wrap his motorcycle in plastic wrap and melt it with a hair dryer? Little trick I learned in gift basket making class.
Jake," All right. Here's what we're up to. Steal his kidney, burn down his house, replace his aloe tissues with regular tissues. Thank you, Charles. You're welcome. Leave a dead cat in his cedar closet. Note: He would have to own a cedar closet."
Rosa, He seems like he would.
Jake," Sneak into his apartment and burn popcorn in the microwave. Thank you, Charles. Uh, Scully asked for mashed potatoes, so I wrote that down. Well, I hate to say it, but I think, by default, Charles' motorcycle idea is the winner."
Charles, Yeah! Winning by default.
Jake, Let's get into it. Anybody know where The Vulture lives?
Rosa," On third, right near here. How do you know that?"
Jake," Chug 'em, boys. We're rolling!"
Charles," Yes! Take that, Vulture!"
Jake," Yeah. Nice. All right, give me your hair dryer."
Rosa, What?
Amy, What are you talking about?
Jake, Don't you carry one in your purse?
Amy, Have you ever met a human woman?
Scully, There's a drugstore four blocks away... I'm on it.
Jake," Oh, no. Scully traveling four blocks? That could take weeks."
Scully, Hoo!
Holt," Take the shot, sergeant."
Terry, I just need a second.
Holt, You've had 18 minutes of seconds.
Gina, [Phone ringing] Gina's authentic stolen police badges. How can I help?
Jake," Hey, it's Peralta."
Gina," Oh, hey, Jake."
Jake," Hey, do you carry a hair dryer in your purse?"
Gina, Of course. I'm not an animal.
Jake, Great. I need you to bring it to The Vulture's apartment.
Gina," There's someone named ""The Vulture""? Tell Rosa. She'd be into that."
Charles, Come on!
Holt," Peralta, why are you asking Gina about Detective Pembroke?"
Jake," Oh, Captain, hello. Uh, we are preparing him a gift basket of sorts."
Holt," Look, I understand that you're upset. But if you want to keep this from happening again, I suggest that you pull your team together and solve these cases before major crimes can step in. Am I clear?"
Jake," Yes, sir. That is definitely clear. Thank you, sir."
Jake, Because the Captain just gave us the perfect revenge plan. We team up and solve this case right now!
Amy, That is not what he meant.
Jake," Think about it, Amy. We go back to the scene of the crime, find the murder weapon, and out-vulture The Vulture! No one gets in trouble if we crack the case."
Amy," Okay, screw it. I'm in."
Jake, Yes! That's right! All right. We're angry. We're getting revenge. We're a little bit tipsy. We should not be driving. We're taking the bus.
Charles, I love the bus!
Jake," So the waitress heard the couple arguing at dinner. Apparently he was having an affair, and it was not the first time. Two years ago, she caught him with a dog walker who was walking his dog, if you know what I mean."
Amy, I do.
Jake, Right?
Amy," Yes, I got it."
Jake, s*x times.
Amy, Mm-hmm.
Jake," Anyways, we know it's the wife."
Amy, You're real talkative now that you want our help.
Jake," All right, it is possible that I should've brought you guys in sooner. But I just get so excited, wrapped up in wanting to solve stuff, you know?"
Amy, I get it. You want to be the best. We all do. You just don't have to be such a butthead about it. What?
Jake, I just can't believe you would call me a butthead.
Amy, Shut up.
Jake, That's so harsh.
Rosa, Hitchcock farts nonstop.
Holt," Still waiting, sergeant."
Terry, It's just the target looks exactly like a friend of mine. It's just freaking me out.
Holt, You have a friend... Who's just a silhouette?
Terry," Yes. Let's all just count to a million. One, two, three, four, five, six... So then lceman says, ""You can be my wingman any day."" And then Maverick says..."
Holt," I've seen the film, sergeant."
Gina," I haven't. What happens next? Goose comes back, right? He's not really dead."
Terry, Goose is gone.
Gina, No!
Terry, I know!
Jake," All right, here's how it went down. 9:45, a man screams. 90 seconds later, wife goes down to the doorman, says a guy murdered her husband and then ran off. We know she's lying. We've just got to find the corkscrew to make our case airtight. I say we role-play, see if something sparks."
Jake," Darling, thank you for a lovely dinner. Perhaps we should have one more drink before bed."
Charles," Don't you ""darling"" me, you philanderer."
Jake," No, you're the husband. The husband had the affair."
Charles, I'm always the victim. I don't want to be the victim.
Jake," Okay, Charles is the door."
Charles, No. I'll be the victim. Don't make me a door again.
Jake," Great. Okay, so... Wife goes into the drawer. Gets the corkscrew. Stab, stab, stab. What did she do with the corkscrew?"
Rosa, She dumps it in the hallway trash chute on the way to the doorman.
Jake," No, we checked the trash, like, ten times. We would've seen a bloody corkscrew."
Jake," All right, Hitchcock, you're up."
Hitchcock, The body. The corkscrew's still in the body.
Jake," No, you're terrible at this. Go sit down. You're up, Diaz."
Rosa," Stab! Then I... Toss the corkscrew out the window, and it lands on a passing car."
Jake, Security cam showed no one driving by at that time and nothing on the street.
Amy," Okay, I want in. But I only want to stab you."
Jake," Fine. Charles, door."
Boyle, Right.
Jake," Okay, uh, sweetheart."
Amy, Time to die.
Jake, That seems a little harsh. What if it was a magnetic corkscrew? If the corkscrew was on a magnet...
Jake, It's stuck halfway down the inside of the trash chute. I figured it out first!
Charles, Wow!
Hitchcock, What's happening?
Jake," You have a ten-pound flashlight in your purse, but not a hair dryer?"
Amy, I can't see far enough down.
Jake, Someone's gonna have to go down in there. Someone with narrow shoulders.
Charles," No! I have broad shoulders. I have narrow hips, but broad shoulders. God!"
Jake, See anything?
Charles, A little lower.
Jake, We're cops.
Charles, Broad shoulders! Stuck! Told you... Broad shoulders.
Pembroke, What kind of precinct are you running here?
Holt," Would you like to sit down, Detective? You seem upset."
Pembroke," Hell yeah, I'm upset. Your team disrupted a crime scene over which they have zero... Zero jurisdiction. They were publicly drunk. Apparently one of them pressed all the buttons on the elevator. Only, maybe he just bumped up against the panel with that big white ass of his."
Amy, What now? Holt is gonna kill you.
Jake, I don't think he will... Because...
Charles, Voila!
Amy, You actually found the corkscrew in the trash chute?
Jake," Stuck to the side, just like you said."
Jakes," Boyle, we're pulling you out!"
Charles, This is the proudest moment of my career. Ah!
Amy," Oh, my God, you guys, we out-vultured The Vulture! [Imitates bird cawing]"
Jake, What the hell was that?
Amy, What? It's a vulture.
Jake," Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna take this corkscrew over to the D.A. So we get the collar, not major crimes."
Terry, Peralta! Now.
Jake, Okay. Before you get mad...
Terry," Shut it! Holt was right. I've been so worried about my own kids, I forgot about my stupid grown-up kids."
Jake, That's insulting.
Terry," I should've been on you guys more. And starting now, I will be. But if you ever do this again, I swear I will crush your head in one hand."
Jake, You don't mean that.
Terry, Try me.
Jake, Okay. Where you going?
Terry, The boss is taking heat for something that's not even his fault. I can't let that happen.
Jake," Wait. Damn it. Look, it's not your fault either. And it's not The Vulture's fault. It's Amy's. I know. I know. It's mine. It's mine, okay? God, I do not love how this worked out."
Jake, Detective Pembroke.
Pembroke, Now what?
Jake," I'd like to cordially invite you to calm down, especially considering that this case has already been solved... By you! Looks like you found the murder weapon. It's a good thing you realized it was magnetically stuck to the inside of the trash chute. Congratulations."
Holt, Cracked the case all by yourself. We done here?
Pembroke," Yeah. Yeah, we're done here. Hey, keep up the bad work, champ."
Jake, Here it comes. Why does he keep touching my butt?
Pembroke, Stay foxy.
Amy, Die lonely.
Jake," Well, case closed. Good work, everyone. Let's, uh, call it a night without any further discussion."
Holt," No! All of you broke into a crime scene under the influence of alcohol, overstepped your jurisdiction, and disobeyed my direct orders. Everyone involved tonight is gonna get written up."
Jake," Okay, fine. Here's everyone who was there. Jake Peralta, J. Peralta, Dr. Jacob Peralta, who has a PhD in slow-jam studies from Funktown State University, also involved was the right honorable J..."
Holt," okay, enough."
Jake," My point is it was a Peralta special, sir. No one else was there."
Holt," Well, Detective, I'm happy to see you're learning how to be part of a team. Everybody go home. Sleep it off."
Terry, Sir? Thank you.
Gina," Ultimately, it was our raw sexual chemistry that helped him overcome his crippling fear."
Gina," You should just stay in the office all day every day and be my bestie. You could join my dance troupe, Floorgasm. We're looking for a man of precisely your..."
Terry," It's gonna be a long road, but I'm ready to get myself back in the game."
Holt, I know you will.
Terry," I mean, eventually... Not tonight. I need to go hug my baby girls. Excuse me."
Charles," Jake, I have to say, the way you handled things with The Vulture yesterday was very mature."
Jake," Well, sometimes in life, you just have to take the high road. [Timer rings] Oop! Time's up!"
Charles, Can't wait to see it.
Jake," Ah, here we go.  That's good suction. Oh! Ooh! Check it out! Perfect, right?"
Charles, Yeah!
Jake, Yeah.
SARGE, I hope you're all well rested. It's gonna be a busy night.
JAKE, The holding cell's completely full. I keep having to separate Hillary Clinton and Kim Jong-Un.
Jake, Stop it! Stop making out! Hey... no! What would Bill say?
Holt," We need two undercovers at the DeKalb street warehouse party. Boyle, you're already in costume as, uh, Joy Behar?"
CHARLES, I'm Mario Batali.
Holts," Okay. And, uh, Santiago, you go with him."
Amy," Yes, sir. Damn it."
Charles," Santiago, I know that you hate Halloween, but stick with me, and I promise you, you will love it."
Amy," Can you magically make everyone kind, sober, and fully dressed?"
Jake," ""Kind, sober, and fully dressed."" Good news, everyone, we found the name of Santiago's s*x tape."
Jake ," Well, ring it up, nerds. I just arrested my first Halloween idiot of the season. He was trying to rob a bank but had a little trouble with the getaway."
Jake," Trying to ""split,"" huh? Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get out on ""a peel."" I'm so glad you're stuck. I've got a million of these. No, no, don't touch the money!"
CRIMINAL, Ugh!
Jake," I swear, these perps are so stupid. I'd make a better criminal than any of them."
Charles," Yeah, you would. You'd be an evil mastermind, and everyone would call you the handsome bandit."
Jake," Thank you, Charles. And the best part is, none of you could catch me."
Holt," I'm fairly certain you would be caught. No, scratch that. I'm 100% sure you'd be caught."
Jake," Ho, ho, ho! All right, challenge accepted."
Holt, I didn't issue a challenge.
Jake, Fine. I'll issue it for you. What's the most valuable thing in your office?
Holt, My medal of valor.
Jake," God, you are such a hero. All right, how about this? I will bet you that by midnight tonight, I can steal the medal of valor from your office."
Holt, Why would I possibly agree to that?
Jake," Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekends, no overtime. And I won't tell anyone here about the time I saw you wearing short shorts outside of work. But if I win..."
Holt, You won't.
Jake," You have to do all of my paperwork tonight, the busiest and spookiest night of the year. And you have to publicly state that I'm an amazing Detective-slash-genius."
Holt, And this won't interfere with you doing your job?
Jake," You mean my job as an amazing Detective-slash-genius? No, it will not. I'll do all of my work, guaranteed."
Holt, I'm considering it. I'm interested. I agree to participate.
Jake, All right. There's the robot I fell in love with.
Rosa walks in with a vic wearing a nun costume, Hey. Sister Steve here got mugged. Some guy dressed as the royal baby punched him and took his wallet.
Sister Steve, She keeps laughing at me.
Rosa,Can't tell you how many nuns I wanted to beat up in catholic school. Ten.
Terry, I didn't know you went to catholic schooL
Rosa, Good. You shouldn't know it.
Terry, I get it. You're so mysterious and tough. But you know what I think? You're actually a big softy.
Sis Steve," No, I think she's really mean."
Terry, You probably read a Maya Angelou poem at your graduation and cried.
Rosa, Didn't graduate. Had to leave.
Terry, Why? What'd you do?
Rosa, Here's a hint. I'm not gonna tell you.
Terry," Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway."
Rosa , tsk
Terry, I'm a Detective. I will detect!
Jake," Hey. Got an arrest file here for the Captain. Drunk and disorderly. So, anyways... Gina! We never talk anymore. How's the dance troupe? Did you get a haircut? What's the Captain's schedule like today?"
Gina," I'm not gonna help you rob him, Jake. I'm his assistant, and I take that job incredibly seriously."
Jake, You're literally making paper airplanes out of police reports right now.
Gina," Well, how am I supposed to get it into that garbage can?"
Jake," Please, Gina?"
Gina," Fine, Captain's got a meeting downstairs in ten minutes."
Jake, You're the best.
Gina, Dina Lohan. I'm wearing her face lotion.
Jake, That's it. Thank you.
Charles," Okay, party's around the corner. Tipster said there'll be a huge amount of drug activity."
Amy, Why is this costume so stiff? And what is that smell?
Charles," The department never washes them, so it's probably vomit. Hey! I got you a chocolate. Yet another great thing about Halloween... chocolate!"
Amy," Thanks. Oh, look. Raggedy Ann is drinking vodka right from the bottle. People think if they put on a costume, they can just get away with anything they want. Halloween is Christmas for jerks. Come on, ma'am. No open containers."
Raggedy Ann," Oh, and why should I listen to you, bone person?"
Amy, It's called skeleton. It's a very common word. Just put the vodka away.
Raggedy Ann, You guys are cops? These guys are cops! [Partiers booing]
Holt," Are you in my ceiling, Peralta?"
Jake, No.
Holt," So what's the plan? You wait for me to leave my office, lower yourself down, take my medal, and win the bet?"
Jake, Who are you talking to? There's no one up here.
Holt," Peralta, just so you know, right now, I am taking my medal off the wall and placing it in a locked safe whose combination is known only to me. The safe, in turn, is locked in the cabinet. The only key to that cabinet is on my person. I'm off to my meeting. Good luck with your plan."
Jake," You think that scares me? I laugh in the face of adversity! Are you still there? Captain, are you still there? I can't hear... Agh! Ow."
Jake, Here you go. Don't touch the butter. What happened? I thought you guys were supposed to be at the warehouse party.
Amy, We got egged. Some of the shell got in my contacts and my hair and my mouth and my bra.
Jake, I can't tell if that's hot or not. Not hot. Eggshell in my bra is not hot.
Jake," Well, it's kinda hot. Boobs go in a bra. Up top. {Charles high fives Jake}Whoo! My man. Well, it sounds like costume duty is going great."
Charles," So great. We're having the best time. Right, Amy?"
Amy, I wish I was dead. Hmm. How's the unwinnable bet going?
Jake," Well, on the one hand, I fell through the ceiling and onto a pencil, but on the other hand, I also badly bruised my brain."
Rosa," If you wanted to make a bet with Holt, you shoulda made a bet you could win. Like who wears more denim jackets."
Jake," That was one time. You guys never forget anything. You know, frankly, I'm a little surprised you don't think I can win this thing. You're always telling me how I'm the best."
CHARLES," You're the best, Jake."
JAKE, Paperwork delivery.
CHARLES," You're the best, Jake."
CHARLES," Jake, you're the best."
JAKE,"Thank you, Charles."
JAKE," Yeah, maybe it's just Charles."
Terry," Look, Jake, I love you like you're one of my daughters."
Jake, Really?
Terry, But it's not about you or how smart you are. It's about Captain Holt. The man's a genius. He's had your number at every turn.
Jake," Well, not this day... Turn... time. Sorry, I'm pretty sure I had a concussion back there. Here I come."
JAKE," Ohh, strong. Ahh."
Rosa," Okay, here's the first set of royal babies I rounded up. Popular costume. Any of these guys look familiar?"
SISTER STEVE, Maybe the third guy. The baby who mugged me was pretty short.
SISTER STEVE, You're not supposed to laugh at me.
rosa," Number three, step forward and say, ""give me your money, you stupid bag of crap."""
SISTER STEVE," No, wrong giant baby."
TERRY, I still want to know why you got kicked out of catholic school. Were you doing drugs?
ROSA, Worse.
TERRY, Selling drugs?
ROSA, Worse.
TERRY, How bad could it have been? Did you burn down a church?
ROSA," Number three, step forward and say the word ""worse."""
HOLT," Excuse me, Gina. I can't find Peralta anywhere, and you're the only one who can decipher his handwriting. He arrested that bunny, but I don't know what for. He's either a crispy mother werewolf or cowboy mustard, oslo, Norway."
GINA," Hmm. The bunny groped multiple women on the subway. Being able to read Jake's writing is a gift. A useless, useless gift."
Holt," Excuse me one second. Nice costume, Peralta."
JAKE, No Peralta here. Just a normal janitor pushing trash around.
HOLT, Come out of there.
JAKE," Captain, hey."
HOLT, You really thought this was gonna work?
JAKE," Uh, it did work. This whole janitor gambit was designed to fail. It's just like in chess. Sometimes in order to win, you have to sacrifice your king."
HOLT, That's exactly how you lose in chess. Have you ever played the game?
JAKE," Yeah, I used to play with my uncle Bob all the time, and he said I was great."
UNCLE BOB," This is a game of concentration, Jake. So focus your mind, and start shooting."
BOB," Now you're a master of chess, huh?"
JAKE, He taught me how to shoot backgammon too.
HOLT, I expected better of you. You could have at least created a diversion to distract me from your terrible costume.
JAKE," Uh, I'm not a dumb butt. I had a diversion planned. There was just a slight timing issue. Oh, my God! Get down, everyone! There's a big fire! Captain, you better head over there for, like, 15 minutes and see what's going on with that. Beware of the back draft. I'll be in your office. You have beautiful eyes. Have it your way. But you're gonna need this. And... that. It's filthy in there."
CHARLES," Come on, Amy! Loosen up! You look like such a cop! Come on, have some fun, you know? It'll help you blend in! Whoo!"
AMY, Stop trying to get me to love Halloween. It'll never work.
CHARLES, I'm backing it up.
AMY," Oh, God, please don't. Hey, heads up. I'll cut 'em off at the exit. Okay."
AMY," He ditched the drugs. I'm on it. Ugh. [Groans] Oof, everything is sticking to me. Ooh. Ay, h. Yes."
Male partier," Hey, watch out, man."
AMY CRINGES , Ugh! What is that? How is it hot and cold?
HOLT, So the soonest you can fix the ceiling is Monday? I'm gonna have to call you back.
JAKE," Wait, stop scratching me. We're supposed to be a team."
HOLT,Ahem.
HOLT, Are you trying to jam pigeons into my air-conditioning vent to flush me out of my office?
JAKE, Way to ruin the surprise.
HOLT, How did you get those birds?
JAEK," By using my big, fat brain."
JAKE CHASING THE BIRDS WITH A BAG," Get in the bag, you damn bird. Eat the bread. Eat the bread! I gotcha! I gotcha!"
JAKE, All part of my elaborate plan to defeat you.
HOLT," So far, you and your big, fat brain are losing... badly."
JAKE," Maybe, if we're talking about who's winning our bet. But if we're talking about who's holding more birds, I'm winning, four-nothing."
HOLT, You're only holding two.
JAKE, Yeah. 
CHARLES," Ooh, when you were logging in the drugs, you missed some awesome stuff. Guy walked by in full astronaut costume, gave me a high five."
AMY,  He high-fived me too.
CHARLES, Wait... Hitchcock?
HITCHOCK," Darn it. I wasn't supposed to talk, but I got so excited about that astronaut."
CHARLES, What is happening?
HITCHCOCK, Amy paid me 50 bucks to trade places with her for the rest of the night.
CHARLES,Really?
HITCHCOCK, Yeah. I'm gonna use that money to buy two suits.
JAKE," Well, I was gonna ask you to tell the Captain that I brought in royal babies for Diaz, but I'm sure he already knows, since he's always one step ahead of me."
Gina," Aww. Why so down, little clown?"
Jake, I'm just sick of losing to Holt. I want that medal.
GINA," It's not real gold. I tried selling it online. Zero bids. But here's some advice I gave to the girls in my dance troupe at the ""dance till you drop"" tournament. That advice was, dance. Dance! Dance."
JAKE," Yeah, I'm not really sure that applies here, Gina."
GINA, It does apply. It means don't give up. We would've won if Natasha's water hadn't broken.
JAKE," Oh, Natasha had her baby?"
GINA, You know Natasha?
JAKE, Yeah.
GINA, Yeah.
Both, Her dog has lupus. Yeah.
GINA, That's a trip.
JAKE,Small world.
GINA, Yes.
GINA,I kind of feel bad for him.
HOLT, Don't. He brought this on himself. You can hang up now.
CHARLES, You paid money to get out of working with me?
AMY," Charles, I had to. Tonight has been awful. Halloween is the worst, and I don't understand why you like it."
CHARLES," No, all the things that you think are bad about Halloween are what make it great. The big kids egg you. Then you and your friends run away together. Friendships are forged in the crucible of Halloween adversity. That's all I wanted for us. You can keep the wig. I don't need it anymore."
AMY, I don't really need it either.
Jake," Hey, Captain Holt, can you come out here for one sec?"
HOLT," You need something, Peralta?"
JAKE," Yes, I do. Hit it, royal babies."
JAKE, What... no!
HOLT, Give me my keys.
JAKE, Will you stop catching me? Do you have any idea how much I spent on key chains?
HOLT, $23.
JAKE," Wow, that is unbelievably close. 22.76."
HOLT, Keys.
JAKE," Okay, look. Tonight has been a little humiliating. Things are not going well, so I'm gonna just throw this out there. What do you say we call off the bet and pretend this whole thing never happened?"
HOLT," Oh, I'm not letting you off the hook."
JAKE," What? No. Pfft. I meant to give you an out, so you could save face."
HOLT, This is getting sad.
JAKE," Yeah, for you. "
Terry, So. I called your school. And I managed to get a hold of one sister Bernadette.
ROSA, I remember that old bag. She was my favorite.
TERRY," Well, guess what she said. Apparently, you were a model student and transferred of your own volition."
ROSA, Fine. The reason I left catholic school was because I got into the American ballet academy. I was a classical dancer. And I was good.
TERRY, I knew it! I knew you were a big softy.
ROSA," You tell anyone, I break your face. {ROSA CLOSES HER DRAWER WITH HER FOOT}"
TEERY," No, you won't. You're too sensitive. [Chuckling]"
AMY," Captain, sorry to interrupt. Some officers just arrested Peralta."
HOLT, What?
AMY,They caught him scaling the side of the building with a blowtorch.
JAKE," Captain. Welcome to the endgame. Would you care to shake the hand of the man who defeated you? Forgot I was wearing handcuffs. Ohh, that hurt. Whoo!"
HOLT, Climbing the side of the building with a blowtorch. What were you thinking?
JAKE," I was thinking I had better core strength. I got winded, like, ten feet up."
HOLT," I knew you wouldn't win the bet, but your performance tonight has made me question not only how good a Detective you are, but, quite frankly, how smart you are."
JAKE," Well, that's not surprising. You constantly underestimate me."
HOLT," No, you've been correctly estimated. You have five minutes until your deadline, and here you are, handcuffed to a table, in a locked room."
JAKE," Which is precisely where I planned on being. Captain, let me tell you a little story. You remember when I fell through your ceiling?"
HOLT," Yes, that was six hours ago."
JAKE," It was, I admit, a disastrous failure. But it gave me the idea for Herman, the friendly janitor you met. With Herman, I commenced the perfect crime."
HOLT, I caught you as Herman.
JAKE, But you didn't catch Rosa.
HOLT, Come out of there.
Jake, It turns out that Rosa is great at picking locks. { ROSA IS PICKING THE LOCK} END OF FLASHBACK
HOLT, Does not surprise me.
JAKE," No, me neither. Of course, I had to find a way to get her out of your office without you seeing her."
Jake, So I created a diversion. Not mistimed... Perfectly timed so she could escape unseen. (ROSA ESCAPES UNSEEN)
HOLT, What about the pigeons?
JAKE," Oh, the gray pigeons?"
Jake, They were a red herring. Thank you. Their only purpose was to draw you into the copy room while two members of my team broke into your locked office. So now I had a way into your office and an open cabinet. All that was left was for the royal babies to steal your keys.(AMY AND TERRY BREAK INTO HIS OFFICE)
HOLT," Yes, but you didn't need the keys. The cabinet was already unlocked. You needed a way into the safe."
JAKE, And I got it.
Jake," You were so concerned with getting your keys back, you didn't even notice the sergeant steal your phone. That's right, even the sergeant is on my side. I then had Charles dust your screen cover for prints. The greasiest smudges revealed the four numbers you use the most... (TERRY TAKES HIS PHONE)"
JAKE," The four numbers in your passcode. Based on your advanced age, I assumed that you use the same passcode for everything... Your phone, your email, and, of course, your safe."
HOLT, That would be a fair assumption.
JAKE," It was at that point that I bumped into a girl dressed as a sexy robot, and we got our flirt on... hard."
JAKE, 'Sup?
GIRL, 'Sup?
HOLT, And how was flirting part of the plan?
JAKE," Oh, it wasn't. It just ruled. And that brings us to five minutes ago, when Amy came to your office and told you that I had been arrested. I knew she's the only one you would believe because, frankly, she's usually too lame to take part in these kinds of things."
Jake," And as you walked over here, Charles awkwardly stuffed himself through your window and opened your safe. We had the four numbers of your code, which meant there were 24 possible combinations for Charles to try. That could take up to four minutes, which is why I really dragged out this explanation.(CHARLES IS SHOWN TRYING OUT DIFFERENT CODES)"
JAKE," I mean, really stretched it. I don't know if you noticed, but there were times where I was like, what am I even talking about? This isn't... (timer goes off) Oh. But now, four minutes is up. Which means Boyle is either on the other side of that door holding your medal, or I've lost."
CHARLES," Well, Captain, it seems that Jake isn't the only person you underestima..."
JAKE,"20 seconds to spare. Game over, Captain. Check me."
HOLT," I think you mean ""checkmate."" You really need to learn how to play chess. How did you get everyone to help you?"
JAKE, I appealed to their sense of teamwork and camraderie with a rousing speech that would put Shakespeare to shame.
JAKE," [Scottish accent] For too long, we've been put down, ridiculed, made to wear ties! But no more! For today, we defeat him!"
HOLT, And that worked?
Jake," My speech did not inspire them. Come on. So I bribed them. I told them that if we pulled this off, I would do all of their paperwork. And since you're doing all my paperwork..."
HOLT," I'm impressed, Peralta. Well done."
JAKE," Thank you, sir."
CHARLES," In fact, the thing that you failed to see, Captain, teamwork, is exactly..."
JAKE, Captain? S
CHARLES, What provided our success.
JAKE,Sir? He's not coming back.
Terry," Boyle, I need you in the briefing room."
CHARLES, What is all this?
AMY," You know how I think Halloween is for jerks? Well, this Halloween, I was the jerk. I'm sorry about tonight."
JAKE," ""I'm sorry about tonight."" We found the title for Santiago's follow-up s*x tape."
CHARLES, I'm sorry I couldn't convince you to love Halloween.
JAKE," ""It's not your fault I was terrible"" is also one of your s*x tapes. (AMY SMACKS JAKE) Ow."
AMY, Halloween is unbearable. But it was slightly less unbearable with you. Don't.
JAKE, Okay.
AMY," Anyway. We're all going to the bar, so get changed, 'cause you can't be the only one there not wearing a 'stume."
CHARLES," 'Stume! Oh, my God. It caught on."
All, No.
JAKE," Ah, Captain Holt. It is so nice to see you. Never thought I'd say that."
HOLT, Hmm. A poor winner. I never would've guessed.
JAKE," Yeah, you would've. Way to go all out on your costume, by the way. I believe you have an announcement to make, so the floor is yours."
HOLT," Attention, everyone. Jake Peralta is an amazing Detective-slash-genius. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some paperwork to do."
Jake, All right.
Rosa, Officer in the 92nd got the royal baby mugger. He had 19 wallets in his diaper.
Officer, We got a runner!
caveman, Waahhh!
TERRY, Damn!
ROSA," Oh, I didn't tell you. I got kicked out of ballet school for beating the crap out of ballerinas."
HITCHCOCK, It's a good thing we gave 'em a heads up.
SCULLY," Team effort, Go 99."
Amy, Careful!
Rosa," You only get one shot at this, Peralta."
Jake, Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. I saw the first 15 minutes of The Hurt Locker.
Amy, Hurry! The stench is too much. We gotta get those shoes outta here.
Rosa, How much time do we have?
Jake," Scully ate his pot pie 30 minutes ago, so we probably got 10 minutes left on this nap. 12 if he's turkey tired. All right, come to papa. [Groans]It's trapped. Abort mission."
Charles," I have an idea...  Jake helps Charles into a bomb squad safe suit, he successfully picks them up"
Jake," Let's send these shoes to hell. Oh, wait."
Jake," Yeah, just smells worse than before. Oh... Ugh!"
Jake, Abort! ♪
Amy, Whoa! Why are you here before me? Am I asleep? Is this a dream?
Jake, I am early because Jimmy Brogan is here today.
Rosa, Why do you care so much about some old reporter?
Jake, Some old reporter? Is the sky just some big blue hat that the world wears?
Rosa, No. And no one has ever thought that.
Jake," My point exactly. Jimmy Brogan wrote The Squad about badass New York cops in the '70s. It's the best book I've ever read, and I've read 15 books."
Amy, 50 books is not a lot. Wait... You said 15?
Jake, The Squad is what made me decide to become a Detective. And it was my first book report.
Young Jake,"  ""The detectives wiped the mobsters' blood off their boots and found the scag."" Scag is heroin, and the book says it's so good, you can never stop doing it!"
Teacher," See me after class, Jacob."
Jake, Fun side note... I late lost my virginity to Mrs. Stratton's daughter. It was... very fast.
Charles, Nice.
Holt," Mr. Brogan, these are detectives Santiago and Peralta."
Jake," Mr. Brogan, I am a huge fan of your book. Would you mind signing my copy?"
Brogan, I'd love to. It's always nice to meet a fan.
Jake,"'You can just make it out to ""death wish."" That's what everyone calls me, 'cause I'm always first through the door."
Amy," You go through doors normally, and everyone calls you pineapples."
Jake," My grandma calls me pineapples, and I regret telling you that. Those New York cops from the '70s you wrote about were my idols... I mean, Gaminsky, Cavanaugh, Quigg."
Brogan, Those guys were the real deal. I once saw Gaminsky choke a hippy to death with his own ponytail.
Amy, Illegal.
Jake, Love that.
Holt," Mr. Brogan is writing an article about how Brooklyn detectives have changed in the 35 years since The Squad. He'll be observing the two of you on your lnternet identity theft case. I hope Mr. Brogan's presence doesn't prove to be a distraction to you, Peralta."
Jake," Distracted? Me? No, sir. Evil would love that. But I'm not giving evil the satisfaction. Not today."
Brogan, Where's the can? I gotta unload.
Jake," ""Unload."" Great choice of words. It'd be an honor to show you, sir."
Terry, All right. Everyone's here. Today we're gonna work on our courtroom demeanor.
Rosa, Pass.
Terry," This seminar is not optional, Diaz. You're testifying in an aggravated assault case tomorrow. The D.A. is worried about how you present yourself on the stand."
Rosa, Why? I'm fine on the stand.
Rosa on the stand,"  Look, I'll make this real simple so even these dum-dums can understand. Man did crime."
Rosa, I'm sorry... can you make her stop doing that weird thing with her face?
Male Lawyer, Crying?
Rosa," And when this is over, I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna break those little fingers."
Judge,  Ms. Diaz. Please stop threatening the stenographer!
Terry, This is an important case. You need to do well.
Rosa, Fine. I'll take your dumbass seminar.
Charles, That's the spirit!
Amy," Someone has placed tiny scanners inside ATMs to steal card numbers and pins which they sell on the lnternet. Oh, good God, why do you smell like an ashtray?"
Jake," Oh, sorry, mom. It's the only way I can cope with the stress of the job."
Amy, Anyway... We're running an algorithm to comb through the transactions looking for a pattern which will lead us to the perp's IP address.
Brogan," Got it. ""Boring mumbo jumbo."""
Jake," Well, you could think of the algorithm as a boot and the IP address as some poor slob's skull. [Smack] You know?"
Brogan," We used to call guys who bragged about sitting around all day hair bags. [Chuckling] Except for Detective Finaldi. No, he had to sit around all day. A mafia thug pried both his kneecaps off with a crowbar."
Jake,  Gah... so lucky.
Amy, This kind of data-driven police work has reduced crime by over 70%.
Brogan, I know hair bag work when I see it. Do me a favor... wake me when your shift is over.
Jake snaps his fingers, No way.
Jake, That is amazing!
Rosa," All you need is for a jury to like you. If they like you, they'll trust you."
Rosa, Fine. How do I get these morons to like me?
Terry, Good instinct!
Charles," Okay. Sit up straight, all right? Be aware of your hands, okay? And don't be afraid to smile. And if you need to buy time, you can always just say, ""to be perfectly candid..."""
Rosa,To be perfectly candid... I like that.
Terry, And always make good eye contact.
Charles, But don't stare at people.
Terry, Yeah. You gotta blink.
Charles, But don't blink too much.
Terry, Or too fast.
Charles, I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.
Terry, Don't blink too fast or too slow or too much or too little.
Rosa, I know how to blink.
Jake," Quick question, sir. You know how we've been trading favors back and forth and it's your turn to give me one?"
Holt, None of that is true.
Jake," Yeah, I know. Please, can I jump onto a sweet mob-related homicide?"
Holt, There are no sweet mob-related homicides on which to jump.
Jake," Boom! There's one at the seven-three. Maybe I should roll over there, help out. Brogan can tag along, maybe write some stuff down."
Holt,Why do you idolize that man and the time he wrote about?
Jake," Because the '70s were amazing. I mean, everyone had thick, juicy moustaches and all the clothes were orange and flammable."
Holt," The '70s were not a good time for the city or for the department... Corruption, brutality, sexism. Diaz and Santiago never would have made Detective, and an openly gay man like me... I never would have been given a command. There were very few black detectives. Did I ever tell you what my first day on the job was like?"
Holt, Hello. I'm Raymond Holt.
White guy, Are you... here to turn yourself in?
Jake," Ah, yeah, that's really messed up. But the guys that Brogan wrote about... They were great detectives. I mean, they were legit."
Holt, Some of them were legit. Some of them were just Brogan's drinking buddies.
Jake," Sir, that is a brilliant idea."
Holt, It wasn't an idea. It was a scathing indictment of your personal hero.
Jake," Eh, six of one."
Jake, This is the best! Drinking with Jimmy Brogan. So tell me more about Quigg. Could he really light a matchstick on his face?
Brogan," One time during a drug bust, he had one of his fingers shot off. He didn't even flinch. He just picked it up and used it to flip off every puerto rican in the place."
Amy, And that's my cue. It's late.
Brogan," Are you kidding? The old guard drank till dawn, ate some coffee grounds, then started the whole day all over again."
Jake, Pfft! I eat coffee grounds.
Amy," Sure you do, pineapples."
Brogan, How about another round?
Jake, Are you kidding me? I wanna hang with you till one of us dies.
Brogan," Look, I'm tired of talking. Why don't you tell me some of your stories?"
Jake," Great. 'Cause I got some stories that'll make Training Day look like Super Troopers. Eh, it's not... bartender. Two scotches."
Brogan," No, no, he meant two bottles."
Jake, What? I mean... yeah!
Bartender, here ya go
Jake, Aaaalll... right! [Laughs]
A struggling Perp, You'll never get me! You'll never get me!
Jake," We already got you, idiot."
Jake, Shh! Turn off your mouth siren.
Amy," Here are the texts I got from you last night. ""Best night ever."" ""Why scotch burn so good?"" ""Whaz his name in Serpico?"" ""Who's the friend of yours with the ping-pong?"" And lastly, a picture of you on the subway platform eating Chinese chicken salad with no shirt on."
Jake," [Laughs] Well, last night was awesome. We had an epic night of bonding that I will never forget."
Jake, Do it! I believe in you.
Jake, Throw it! I believe in you.
Jake," Man, I wonder if Brogan's okay. He's 65 and drank two bottles of scotch. He might be dead."
Brogan," Morning, kid! Ooh! How ya doing?"
Jake, Uh... hey... So good. I feel great. And I definitely don't think it's burning hot in here.
Brogan," Well, I'm around. Grab me if anything develops in your case. (Smacks Jakes back)"
Jake," [ You got it. That hurt so bad. Let me know when he's gone so I can slide onto the nice, cool floor."
Amy, He's gone.
Rosa, Why are we meeting in the ladies' room?
Terry, It's the perfect place for our second lesson... Courthouse wardrobe.
Rosa, What's wrong with the way I dress?
Charles," You know, some people might say that all the black leather kind of makes you looks like an evil villain. Not me. I think you look like a sexy motorcycle."
Terry," Boyle, pull it together."
Charles, Yeah.
Terry, We need to soften up your look. My wife and Charles's mom donated some clothes.
Rosa, Your wife and Boyle's mom are both blind?
Rosa, I look like arsenio.
Charles, So it's... perfect?
Charles, That's actually my wedding suit.
Rosa, No.
Rosa, Yes.
Charles,No.
Terry, No.
Terry, That's great.
Charles, Perfect! You look beautiful... ly... Appropriate for court.
Jake,  Ohh... Scully.
Scully," Hey, Jake."
Jake, You've been alive forever. How'd you used to cure hangovers?
Scully," Oh, I didn't drink. I was, however, extremely into cocaine for most of 1986."
Scully," I gotta tell you the truth, Hitchcock... Can I tell you the truth? You and me, man. We're gonna be co-captains. But first I'm taking you to Japan!"
Hitchcock, I'm already packed!
Scully, I had three heart attacks that year and declared bankruptcy. Hitchcock turned out just fine.
Amy, My grandpa was an old-school cop. This was his hangover cure... Raw egg yolks.
Jake, Aaahhh!
Holt, You look like a corpse we just pulled out of the river.
Jake, Wrong. I look like a cool rock star who oded in his own pool. Big difference.
Holt,: I told you not to let Jimmy Brogan distract you from your work. So I assume you're not too hung over to do said work?
Jake, Pfft. Nope. It's like I never even drank.
Holt, And that's not a hangover cure.
Jake," What, that? Naw, it's just some... Protein for my guns. I drink one every morning before I lift. So... Gah! Ah ha ha! So good! You can barely even tell it's a chicken embryo."
Amy, Yeah.
Jake,"  Agh. Ah, it's just like... Fitness, right?"
Amy, mhm
Jake," Oh, why did I do this?"
Amy," According to your text, you were having ""the beef light of my loaf."""
Jake," What? No, no. Why did I use this algorithm? We're only tracking people who use the stolen cards. They might not be the same as the ones who stole them. Here, switch seats with me. Oh, wow. Your butt's really warm."
Amy, My butt's normal. Your butt's the weird one.
Jake," Don't be mad. It's nice. All right, so if we ignore all these fraudulent purchases and go back far enough... Here. Someone posted the stolen card numbers online from this IP address."
Amy, Not bad! You found the pattern.
Jake," All right, let's aspirin up and roll out! Ah... ohh! Ohh..."
Jake, I'm glad you could be here for this.
Jake, Mike Halbrook. NYPD. Open up.
Brogan, Put your head through the door.
Jake, My head?
Amy, We got a runner! Stop!
Jake," Hands in the air! Oh, wow."
Jake," Hoo! Yeah! Good job. I'm never drinking again. Hey. You know, I was gonna take him out myself, but ladies first, so..."
Brogan," Relax, kid. Being too hung over to chase a perp? That's a classic old-school move. You know, you are one of the last few good cops fighting against the rising tide of hair bags."
Jake, That's what you're gonna say in your article?
Brogan," Ah, don't worry, you're gonna come out lookin' real good. Especially after our talk in the bar. Ah... So many good quotes! Especially about Holt. Cops are usually afraid to go after their captains like that, but you, sir, are old-school."
Jake, You know it.
Amy," Oh, pineapples... What did you do?"
Judge, Your witness counselor.
Make lawyer," Detective Diaz, it's always a pleasure to see you."
Charles, This is not good. The lawyer is that slimeball grundhaven... Rosa hates him!
Terry, She's dressed right. We coached her. She'll be okay.
Lawyer, Would you please state your name for the record?
Rosa, To be perfectly candid... My name is Detective Rosa Diaz.
Lawyer," Well, thank you for your candor regarding your own name. [Chuckles] Detective Diaz, would you please tell the court exactly how you're involved in this case?"
Rosa, I caught Mr. Ladd physically beating his boss with a fax machine. Most of his cheek was caved in. His head was basically a blood fountain.
Lawyer," I'm sorry, is this amusing to you, Ms. Diaz?"
Terry and Charles,  Blinking.
Judge, are you alright detective?
Jake," Oh, no. Brogan just sent me the quotes he's gonna run. I slammed Holt like 50 times. Listen. ""Holt would rather I wear a tie than solve a case. Holt cares more about catching clerical errors than catching bad guys. Holt is way too verticulis""? That's not even a word!"
Amy," What were you thinking? We were just hanging out, being old-school. He wasn't supposed to quote me. I was off the record the whole time. Oh, no wait."
Jake, I'm goin' on the record. Jake Peralta... Can dance! Whoo! Whoo!
Jake,  Jimmy Brogan!
Amy," You need to fix this, okay? Those quotes cannot run. It would be devastating for Holt. And the department."
Jake," I'll fix it. Brogan's a cool guy. We're friends now. I'll just talk to him, awesome dude to awesome dude. I should brush my teeth first, though, right?"
Amy, Mm-hmm.
Jake," Yeah, that's terrible. Ugh!"
Rosa," Great advice, dummies. I look like a psycho up there!"
Charles, Yes. You have to pull it together.
Rosa, That's not helping!
Charles," That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous. Rosa, I think you're nervous."
Rosa, Of course I'm nervous! What did you think was the problem?
Terry, We just assumed you were a terrifying human being with a short fuse.
Charles," But if the problem is that you're nervous, that's where Charles Boyle lives, baby. I can help! You just need to go to your happy place."
Rosa, What's that? Sounds stupid.
Charles," Oh, everyone's happy place is different. For me, I just imagine I'm slurping up the world's longest piece of linguini. It just keeps going and going. Every 20 feet of noodle, there's a sauce change. I'm in my happy place right now. Mmm... pesto. [Slurps] Mmm! Carbonara!"
Rosa, Great! Now I'm starving!
Jake," Hey, hey, Jimmy Brogan. Thanks for meeting me."
Brogan," Welcome to the Schvitz, kid. The most comfortable place on earth. It's like crawling back into your mother."
Jake, Is that something people wanna do?
Jake," What'd you wanna talk to me about? So I read those quotes you sent me, and you... Wrote them so good. The thing is... I know I hid it incredibly well, but I was pretty drunk when I said that stuff, so... Any chance you wouldn't print it?"
Jake," Well, you said you were going on the record. I was clearly not in control."
Brogan," Well, maybe you should learn to handle your brown."
Jake," Eew. Look, you know that I think you're like the number one hero of the 20th century. But kinda feel like you're being unfair here."
Brogan," ""Feel like""? Listen to her, Suzanne Somers over here. Talk like a man."
Jake," All right, I will talk like a man. You got me drunk and took advantage of me."
Brogan," Oh, come on."
Jake," Gah! Look, I'm asking you nicely... Please don't print the quotes."
Brogan," And I'm telling you nicely, I'm printing them."
Jake," No, you're not."
Brogan, What are you gonna do about it? [Chuckles]
Amy," Hey, how'd it go with Brogan?"
Jake, Perfect. Except I punched him in the face and made everything a billion times worse.
Amy, What?
Lawyer," Yeah. So, Detective Diaz, you saw my client struggling with his boss, but you don't know who initiated the fight."
Rosa," To be perfectly candid, I was pretty sure it was the defendant."
Lawyer," Oh, to be perfectly candid, ""pretty sure"" is not definitive."
Rosa, I think I know what happened.
Lawyer," Well, to be perfectly candid, no one cares what you think. Do you actually know anything, or are you just guessing?"
Rosa, Your client instigated the fight. I'm certain. And I'm happy to tell you why.
Charles, She went to her happy place.
Terry," I know that, Boyle."
Holt, You punched Jimmy Brogan? What were you thinking?
Jake, I was thinking that I needed to protect this precinct. From things that I said about this precinct to a reporter while drunk and insisting he record me. I shouldn't have done it.
Holt," Unbelievable. Every time I think you might make a decent Detective, you go and pull something like this."
Jake," I thought I could handle my brown. Oh, I'm sorry. It's gross."
Holt, Go home! You got the rest of the day to put your head on straight.
Holt," Got Halbrook to cop to every charge. Nice work, Santiago."
Amy," Thank you, sir. Peralta figured out the pattern, though, so he should get credit for the collar. Have you seen him?"
Holt, I sent him home. He assaulted Jimmy Brogan.
Amy," Yeah. But that caveman kinda had it coming, don't you think? Oh. He didn't tell you."
Holt, Tell me what?
Amy," Never mind. If Jake didn't tell you, he must have had a reason. It's not my place."
Holt," I'm disappointed in you, Santiago. I thought you and I were close."
Amy," I know you're manipulating me... But I love it, and I will tell you anything. So Jake went to the Schvitz to talk to Brogan."
Brogan, What are you gonna do about it? [Chuckles]
Jake," There's nothing I can do... Except to ask you nicely as a fan of you, your work, and the guys you wrote about... Please don't print the quotes."
Brogan, Sheesh. I didn't realize you were gonna get your panties all in a pretzel!
Jake, That's actually not technically possible. I'm not wearing underwear. It is swampy in here. My butt's like the everglades.
Brogan," Look, I know you're trying to be legit in a hair bag world, so I will not print your quotes."
Jake," Ah, thank you, thank you! That means the world to me. And for the record, I know that Holt is a stickler, but he's actually a really good cop."
Brogan, Don't worry about it. We're friends. You don't have to stick up for that homo.
Jake, I really wish you hadn't just said that.
Brogan," What, homo? Ooh!"
Holt," Thank you, Santiago. That'll be all."
Charles, Here she is.
Terry,"Diaz, you did it. They found him guilty on all charges."
Rosa, Huh. Boyle's advice worked.
Charles,  So... Where's your happy place?
Rosa," I'm in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. Inside it's just me and that stupid, slimy defense attorney."
Terry, Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and schedule you for a psych eval.
Rosa," I owe you one, Boyle. Thank-you dinner. Tomorrow night. Gribaldi's. It's all-you-can-eat linguini."
Charles, Yes!
Rosa," Oh, my boyfriend's coming too."
Charles, Your what friend now?
Jake, All right. Let's hear it.
Amy," Well, it's even worse than I imagined. [Ahem] ""The new face of the NYPD is perfectly embodied by Brooklyn's own Jake Peralta..."""
Jake, That's not so bad.
Amy," ""Who cowers behind his desk all day like the true hair bag that he is."""
Jake, There it is.
Amy," ""The old guard would have eaten a guy like Peralta for breakfast and unloaded him by lunch."""
Jake," Well, it's very colorful. And hurtful."
Holt," You can ignore that garbage, Santiago. Jimmy Brogan wouldn't know a legit cop if he punched him in the face."
Jake, Well... Guess I'm done with this.
Amy, Not good enough.
Jake," Three, two, one... [Beep beep]"
Jake," Welcome to the party, pal!"
Amy," God, you love that movie."
Jake, It's Die Hard.
JAKE, Okay -- you take the little one on the
CHARLES, No way I’m arresting Santa. Can’t do it.
Reveal, TWO SANTA CLAUSES are BRAWLING.
JAKE," You gotta do it. Santa breaks the law,"
CHARLES, No. Even your cool cop talk can’t
JAKE," Fine. Then I’m going in alone. (to the Santas) NYPD! Santa, stop hitting Santa! The Santas stop."
JAKE, (CONT’D)
LITTLE SANTA," I been on this corner for six years, and"
BIG SANTA," You don’t own the corner. I got a charity, too."
LITTLE SANTA, “Canine diabetes?” Who cares about fat dogs?!
BIG SANTA, They can’t give themselves shots! They have paws!
JAKE," All right, calm down. Boyle, frisk the skinny one. BROOKLYN NINE-NINE ""Christmas"" Pink Revised Pages 10/15/13 1."
CHARLES, I’m not frisking Santa.
JAKE," Fine. I’ll do it. But if I find any presents, I’m keeping them."
JAKE," Aaargh! Get Santa off me! God, you reek of booze Big Santa gets involved, then Charles -- it’s a melée. Jake tries to pry Big Santa off Charles."
JAKE," Wha-- aw, gross, there’s burrito in his beard!"
CHARLES," Punch Santa! Punch him in his fat, cherry cheeks! Jake punches Big Santa. Little Santa pulls out a knife and faces Jake."
JAKE," Knife! Santa has a knife! From behind, Charles KICKS Little Santa in the nuts. He goes down."
CHARLES, That’s right! Boom! I just kicked Santa in the testicles!
CHARLES, ...Merry Christmas!
AMY, You look happy. Let me guess: your egg sandwich fell on the floor and they gave it to you for free?
JAKE, No. They do that? Why doesn’t everyone just drop their sandwich on the floor?
AMY, I was trying to insult you.
JAKE, And instead you gave me an amazing life hack! I’m smiling because I met someone and I think she may be my soulmate.
JAKE, Do you have these in any other color?
HENNA, Maybe in the back. I don’t know. I’m really lazy.
JAKE, Nice. ‘Sup?
AMY, She sounds charming.
JAKE," I know, right? She’s basically Garfield in a hot lady’s body. I’ll take her out for lasagna!"
JAKE," Oh no, Amy, this is embarrassing. I didn’t get you anything. Wait... I did get you something. A nice fresh hot cup of coffee. He hands her a CUP OF COFFEE from off his desk."
AMY," This is cold and it’s tea from yesterday. The present is for Captain Holt. It’s one of six gifts I got him, representing each of the six lessons he’s taught me: determination, wisdom, posture--"
HOLT," Excuse me, everyone. As you may know, it is the holiday season. Detectives sometimes feel the urge to buy their captains holiday presents. Please refrain from doing that. Under no circumstances do I want a present. Peralta, my office."
AMY, Oh god. I have to return so many items.
HOLT," Thank you for joining us, Peralta. This is Deputy Chief Gerber."
JAKE," Merry Christmas, Chief. And a very merry Christmas to you, Captain. Ho-ho-ho!"
GERBER, Captain Holt has received a number of death threats.
JAKE, Oh! I really came in here with the wrong energy.
HOLT, Captains receive meaningless threats all the time. It’s not a big deal.
JAKE," Of course, no, totally. Why would a death threat be a big deal? Oh right, because it threatens death."
HOLT," It’s a hoax. I don’t want to alarm the squad, so please keep this between us."
JAKE, Awesome. I love secrets! Santiago got you like six presents.
GERBER, Protocol dictates Captain Holt must have a security detail with him at all times. He has chosen you for that detail.
JAKE, Interesting. And not at all surprising. I’m his favorite. Now what exactly does that job entail?
GERBER," You’ll be assigned to Captain Holt. You’ll be entirely in control of his movements. He will not leave your sight. You have the authority to make decisions you feel are in the best interests of his safety. Basically, you will be completely in charge."
JAKE, Mmm hmm. Yes. Interesting. Omigod. This is amazing.
JAKE," Well. I would gladly put my life at risk for this man...to have to follow all my orders. Thank you. This is the greatest Christmas ever. God bless us, everyone!"
CHARLES," Hey, my flight is at eight tonight. It’s domestic. Do you think I’ll be safe if I get to the airport five hours early?"
GINA, I would give yourself at least seven.
Charles, “You’re right.”
GINA, Why are you going on a singles cruise anyway? I thought you were into Rosa.
CHARLES," Well, I am. But I’ve begun to feel like there is a small chance Rosa may not love me back."
CHARLES," Hey, you wanna grab some dinner tonight?"
ROSA, That’s nice. And I like you as a person. But I’m just not interested in you romantically.
CHARLES, Coolio.
CHARLES, Whattaya say we grab a drink?
ROSA," Again: that’s sweet. But I’m not into you that way, and I have a boyfriend."
CHARLES, Gotcha! Raincheck.
CHARLES," A rose for Rosa. You know, romantic chemistry is really --"
ROSA, -- something that I have with my boyfriend. Listen to me: the healthy thing for you to do is move on.
CHARLES, Your touch is electric.
ROSA, Move. On.
CHARLES, So we’ve both decided that the healthy thing for me to do is move on.
GINA," I’m impressed, Boyle. That’s very mature."
CHARLES," Thanks. You know, I kind of just realized--"
GINA," Oh I’m sorry, that wasn’t an invitation to keep talking."
CHARLES, Gotcha. Raincheck on that convo.
AMY," Peralta’s busy, so let’s just get started. Now, the captain won’t allow us to give him all the presents we bought him--"
ROSA, You’re the only one who did that.
AMY," --but, we can make him the greatest Christmas card of all time! We’re going to wear Santa hats and big sweaters and take a picture of all of us in a line-up."
TERRY," Sorry, Santiago, I don’t have time for that. My psych evaluation is today. They’re gonna decide if I’m ready to go back on the streets."
GINA, Why do you care what they think? Psychologists are just people who weren’t smart enough to be psychics.
AMY," Don’t worry, Sergeant -- we’ll add you in later."
CHARLES," Uh, I have to go, too. My flight’s in... Oh boy. Eight hours. I can make it, I’ll just buy a sandwich on the plane."
ROSA," So, if Boyle, Peralta, and the sergeant are out--"
AMY," Gah, fine, everyone just go. Everyone starts to file out."
GINA, I could take a picture of myself dressed as an elf. Elfie-selfie!
HOLT, Are you going to sit there all day?
JAKE," Affirmative, Stone Eagle. That’s the Secret Service codename I gave you. I’m just doing my job: watching, protecting, bossing you around. Now, for your"
JAKE," Whoa whoa whoa -- where are you going, Cold Mountain? I changed your codename."
HOLT, To use the restroom.
JAKE," I’m only asking this for your safety: is it a number one or number two? Your silence indicates number two. Jake heads to the door, opens it a tiny crack and peers out."
JAKE," Coast is clear, sir. Go go go! Holt slowly walks out. Jake watches him go."
JAKE, Cold Mountain is on the move. Cold Mountain is rolling to the can.
HILLARY," Okay, Sergeant Jeffords, thank you for coming in. We’re here to assess your readiness for active duty. If all goes well, I’ll stamp the release form and you can go back in the field."
TERRY, I think I’m ready. I’m no longer fixating on my fears.
HILLARY," Good, good. But today, let’s fixate on those fears."
TERRY, Okay. That sounds... fun.
HILLARY," Let’s begin by talking about your baby girls, and your wife, and what would happen to all of them if you died in the line of duty? was on the couch. There is stuffing on him."
TERRY, ...I popped your pillow.
JAKE, Well well well. We meet again. Where exactly do you think you’re going?
HOLT, Your constant hovering is going to draw attention to the situation. The last thing I want is for the rest of the precinct to get involved. I’m going home to work in peace.
JAKE," Negative, Ice Veins -- I changed your code name again -- you’re not going anywhere."
HOLT, Do you know why I picked you to be my security escort?
JAKE," Because I am a 21st century Sherlock Holmes. Boyle is my Watson, and Santiago is my Moriarty. I will defeat her."
HOLT," I chose you because the threat is not real, and I thought you’d have no problem breaking the rules and letting me do my work. Now, let me go."
JAKE, Okay. But your house is off-limits -- protocol. If you really want to get out
HOLT, Fine. We will go to your mother’s place. I guess I am curious to see where......this all started.
JAKE," You’ll love it. She has a great internet connection. Not bragging, just true."
JAKE," Soooo, this is my mom’s house. Just throw your coat in the closet."
HOLT, That’s a bathroom.
JAKE, ...Water closet. My mom is British.
HOLT, Why are there no pictures of you? And no holiday decorations? And nothing but motel art... This isn’t your mom’s apartment.
JAKE," It’s a safe house, son! You been protected!"
HOLT, Get out of my way. I’m leaving.
JAKE," You refused to stay at your desk, you evaded your protection detail. Sorry: I’m ordering you to stay. God, I love giving you orders!"
HOLT," If you want me to stay, you’re going to have to physically stop me. Can you dothat, Peralta? Didn’t think so."
JAKE, Oh no! We’re handcuffed together and we’ve lost the key! Falconer One to HQ: Stone Eagle is in the cage. Repeat: Stone Eagle is in the cage.
HOLT, I told you the death threat was not serious. So: what. On Earth. Are you doing?
JAKE," I know you think I’m just goofing around, but I was ordered to protect you -- by your boss. From here on out, we are in lockdown."
HOLT, Fine. But before we go into lockdown --
JAKE," Too late, you’re in it."
HOLT, I’d like to text my husband and tell him I’ll be coming home late.
JAKE," Fine. But for security reasons, I get to craft the message."
JAKE," Let’s start with a nice greeting, like “Hello, honey.”"
HOLT, You’re not crafting the message.
JAKE," Copy that -- “honey” isn’t right. “Hello, husband?” “Hello, sir?” You call each other ‘sir’?"
HOLT, Give me my phone.
JAKE, Fine. I’ll give you some privacy.
AMY," Maybe, put Scully’s head on top of the tree like an angel? Nah. Put it behind the tree. Thanks for helping me make this card. You’re so good at this stuff."
GINA, I know. I’m good at everything. Here’s every picture we have of Rosa. Which face should we use?
AMY," Uh, she never smiles. Is her mouth broken?"
GINA, How about we...flip those lips!
AMY, Oh god. *
GINA, Yikes. That’s horrifying.
AMY, This is awful. We need to get a picture of Rosa smiling. Holt’s card has to be perfect.
HITCHCOCK," Guys, I got this. I can make Rosa smile. Keep your cameras ready."
HITCHCOCK, Making coffee? Can you make another cup for -- Señor Tickle and his nueve amigos? Hitchcock holds up his hands. Gina and Amy realize what’s happening.
AMY ," Hitchcock, no! *"
GINA, So creepy!
HITCHCOCK, Tickle tickle tickle aarrrghhh -- !
ROSA," What the hell, Hitchcock?"
HITCHCOCK, Ow ow ow. You sprained Señor Tickle.
ROSA ,Next time I break it off.
JAKE," Okay, my safe house, my rules: this is a no-tie zone."
JAKE, Aaaaaah.
HOLT," So this is the plan, you’ve got a little bit of power and you’re going to lord it over me?"
JAKE, Oh no. This is all part of a detailed security protocol. Phase one: no ties. Phase two: sandwiches.
JAKE, A hungry safe house is an unsafe-safe house.
JAKE, It’s terrible! Try it.
JAKE, A fun safe house is a safe-safe house.
JAKE, I win.
HOLT, Impressive.
JAKE, A “Safe House”-watching safe house is a safe-safe-house-house!
HOLT, I’ve already seen the movie. I enjoyed it.
JAKE, Wow. I would not have guessed that. Those are the kinds of things you find out when you’re handcuffed together. And that is the true meaning of Christmas.
JAKE, Who knows we’re here?
JAKE, Get behind me.
HOLT," Standard protocol would have you put me in another room before opening the door, but since you cuffed us together..."
JAKE, I order you to be quiet.
JAKE, Just - ugh. You go there. No I’ll be here.
HOLT," I can’t. The handcuffs. You go here, I’ll go--"
JAKE, Hands in the air!
CHARLES, Aaaaagh! Jake it’s me Charles from work!
TERRY," ...and then Toni Morrison and Terry Bradshaw would hand my wife a folded-up American flag, and hold each other and cry. That would be my perfect funeral."
HILLARY," Okay. Let’s switch gears here, and do some word association. What do you think of when I say the word: ”bottle”?"
TERRY," Liquor store, hold up, gun, die."
HILLARY, How about: “grass.”
TERRY," Marijuana, drugs, gun, die."
HILLARY, Mm-hmm. And the word: “cat”?
TERRY," Kitten, cute, calm, false sense of security, gun, die. Hillary slowly reaches over and closes the INK PAD for the rubber stamp."
TERRY, What are you doing? Are you going to stamp my form?
HILLARY," No, I just don’t want the ink to dry out."
JAKE," Charles, what are you doing here? I thought you had a plane to catch."
CHARLES," I do. My flight is in six hours! But the Captain texted me to come, so I’mhere."
JAKE," I can’t believe you texted Boyle when you said you were texting your husband! As the person who is completely in charge here, I’m very disappointed in you. I’m changing your code name to Bad Boy."
HOLT, I can’t imagine what it’s like to be disappointed by someone under your command.
JAKE, I see what you’re doing there. Tushy.
HOLT, It’s touché.
JAKE," Well, I’m in charge and I like to say tushy. Charles?"
CHARLES, ...I’ve heard it both ways. Please don’t involve me in this. I’m just here to uncuff the captain and take him to his old precinct like he asked.
JAKE, What? Wait a minute. Old precinct? You weren’t going home. You were going to investigate the threat... because it’s not a hoax. It’s real.
HOLT, Wrong. It’s not real.
JAKE," You’re lying! You have a tell. When you lie, the corner of your mouth moves. And it just moved."
HOLT, It’s not real. The corner of his mouth twitches almost imperceptibly.
JAKE, You’re lyiiiiinngggg!
HOLT," Fine. I believe the threat is real, though I’m not sure who’s behind it. But it’s my problem, and I need to solve it on my own. Boyle: uncuff me."
JAKE," Don’t do it, Charles. I’m your best friend slash idol. Don’t make me just your idol!"
HOLT, Un-cuff me. That’s an order.
JAKE, Don’t do it... best friend.
CHARLES," Ugh, this is just like Christmas at my parents’ house. Why did they have separate dining rooms?! I-- don’t -- Aaaaaah!!!"
JAKE, NO!
HOLT, NO!
JAKE, That was not one of the options!
CHARLES, What happened? I blacked out.
JAKE," So including letters, emails, and texts from a blocked phone, you’ve received ten threats. How many people have you put away that might want to kill you?"
HOLT, I’ve arrested over 600 people.
JAKE," Brag. Charles, read the transcripts of the threats he’s received."
CHARLES," “Die, Die, Die,” “Die, Holt, Die.”"
JAKE, Kind of obvious. Lame.
CHARLES, “You will drown in your own blood.”
JAKE, Better. I would’ve gone the “stapling your face onto my face” route.
CHARLES, Human skin mask. Classic. The next one is: “I’m going to send you off the deep end.”
JAKE, That’s strange. “Drowning” and “Deep end.“ It’s like he’s talking about a swimming pool.
HOLT, It’s Haimes.
JAKE, A-ha! Who’s Haimes?
HOLT, Collin Haimes. The “Free-Style Killer.” * He took out an entire 4x100 meter swim relay team in 1982. 
YOUNG HOLT, Marco. Now you say “Polo.” Punk.
JAKE, The Free-Style Killer?! Why did all the killers you caught have such cool names? The best one I ever arrested was Narrow Shoes Sam. Because --
HOLT," His shoes were narrow, and his name was Sam. I get it."
JAKE," Looks like you need us. Together we figured out it was Haimes, and together we’re going to find him, because together, we can do anything."
HOLT, I’m finding Haimes alone. Without you.
CHARLES," Comin’ back at you, Jakey!"
AMY," Oh my god! Rosa! I accidentally opene your mail. Look what it says... “Dear Miss Diaz, you just won --”"
GINA," Rosa, I just opened your mail by accident. “Dear Miss Diaz...”"
AMY," I’m reading the letter, you’re taking the picture."
ROSA," Ha! I get it. You were trying to get me to smile for your dumb card, but you messed up."
AMY, You smiled! She’s smiling! And no one has a camera.
SCULLY," Got it, Amy! Got a picture of you frowning. That’s what you wanted, right?"
JAKE, Move your arm.
HOLT," Peralta. For the last time, we do not need to go to the precinct. I don’t need everyone’s help."
JAKE," Captain, you’re stubborn and that’s an adorable quality. But you know what’s not an adorable quality?"
JAKE, Being dead. *
CHARLES," Acne. Yup, being dead."
JAKE, I give up! What is going on? Why are you being so weird about this?
HOLT," I don’t want to involve you, or Boyle, or anyone else, because I brought this situation on myself. No one should get hurt because of a dumb mistake I made as a brash, young detective."
YOUNG HOLT," Hey, Haimes. You’re gonna spend the rest of your life in a little cement room doing nothing. And while you’re in there, I’m gonna go for a swim. An  after that swim I might take another swim. And you’ll just be sitting there on your metal toilet, thinking of me swimswim-swimming all day long."
YOUNG HAIMES," When I get out of lockup, I’m gonna hunt you down and kill you."
HOLT, Yeaaaaaah right.
JAKE, Wow. I think I would have really gotten along with Young Ray Holt.
HOLT, Yes. That’s why I decided to change everything about my life.
JAKE," Well, frankly, right now you’re acting like that same brash dumb detective. If you’d really changed, you’d be saying boring responsible stuff like: “Don’t be stupid. Let the detective squad help you. You’re part of a team. I smell like sandalwood.”"
CHARLES, That’s what it is! Holt sighs. Jake has a point. The room is a COMMAND CENTER. People BUSTLE AROUND. Charles and Rosa work on laptops and talk on the phone. Scully and Hitchcock are in the back of the room. Holt and Gina sit in
AMY," Sir, I’m sure you had your reasons for going to Peralta, but this is exactly the type of job I would love to have."
HOLT," Okay. Next time someone threatens to kill me, I’ll come straight to you."
AMY," Thank you, sir. I can’t wait. I didn’t mean -- let’s catch this bastard. Jake walks to the front, large and in charge."
JAKE, Updates. Let’s go. Santiago?
AMY, Looking into Haimes’ known associates. Nothing yet.
JAKE, Boyle?
CHARLES, Got some intel coming in from Ossining. Haimes was released two weeks ago.
JAKE, Scully and Hitchcock -- where are we on your special project?
SCULLY, The hazelnut coffee will be up in five minutes.
HITCHCOCK, And the Sumatran is ready to go. Scully and Hitchcock high-five each other.
ROSA, Warrant for the phone trace came through. We got Haimes’s number... and the last coordinates from its GPS.
ROSA, The rail yards.
JAKE," Got him! All right, everyone. Suit up. I know there’s no point in telling you not to come. But you’re staying with me."
HOLT," Oh, goodie."
JAKE, Man. You really take the fun out of saving your life. Let’s hit it! They all CHARGE OUT -- leaving Scully and Hitchcock.
SCULLY," You heard him, Hitchcock! Get that Sumatran in a Thermos!"
HITCHCOCK, On it! They storm off.
JAKE," Okay. Haimes is armed and dangerous, so remember: watch your six, keep the radio open, and Santiago -- try to channel your lust for me into your police work. There’s too much at stake."
JAKE," If things go south, I want you to know: it was an honor being able to order you around."
HOLT, Anything else?
JAKE, Yes. What cute little nickname do you call your husband?
HOLT, Kevin.
HOLT, We have to flush him out. We have his number now -- call his phone.
JAKE, It’s ringing. This is so exciting! That’s Haimes’s phone. Converge on that amazing ring tone. This guy is awesome.
HOLT, He is trying to kill me.
JAKE, Yes. I knew there was something.
AMY, He’s heading north on track 17.
JAKE," When this is over, we should take a train trip together. Just for fun."
HOLT, Go go go!
HAIMES, Ray Holt! Holt and Jake turn around.
HOLT," Hello, Haimes."
JAKE, I’m Peralta. Not a big deal. Put the gun down!
HAIMES," I thought about you every day I was in jail, just like you said. I thought about pointing a gun at you and pulling the trigger, kind of like this -- Haimes is about to shoot. Jake RAISES HIS GUN --"
TERRY, Nooooooooo!
TERRY, Terry’s back! Terry’s back!
JAKE, We got him! We got him!
HOLT," Nice job, Jeffords! Nice job, Peralta!"
JAKE," Oh my god, sir. It’s happening -- you’re emoting."
ROSA, I need an ambulance. Boyle’s down!
ROSA, He got shot in the ass.
CHARLES, Am I dead? What happened?
ROSA, You saved my life.
CHARLES, Myyyyyyy buuuuuuuuuuuutttttt!
ELAINE, He’s going to be fine. You can see him in a minute.
AMY, I’m so glad the shrink cleared you.
TERRY, Mmm. More or less.
HILLARY," Okay, time’s up. Show me your tree. Oh no..."
TERRY, Yeah...it’s pretty bad. The door opens and Gina enters.
HILLARY, Excuse me. We’re in the middle of --
GINA," Can it, quack. Captain Holt’s life is in danger and he needs your help. Terry grits his teeth. Stands up."
HILLARY," Sergeant, I’m not sure you’re ready -- Terry stamps the paper dramatically."
TERRY, I’m ready. He storms out. Gina turns to Hillary.
GINA, Kay bye!
TERRY, I owe you one. Woo! Terry’s back!
HOLT, Boyle got shot because of me. This is exactly the kind of thing I wanted to avoid.
JAKE," Captain, this is our job. Any one of us would’ve taken that bullet."
HOLT, I’m sorry I made this so difficult. You were right. We couldn’t have caught him without the team.
JAKE, Oh ho. It appears the student has become the teacher. And the teacher has become--
HOLT, That’s enough. Thank you.
JAKE, You’re welcome. Team pop and lock! Still?! Come on! We saved your life. Oh my god! We did it! Oh my god!
CHARLES, Everyone should go home and enjoy their Christmas. You don’t have to stick around here for me.
JAKE, We’re not going anywhere. What you did was amazing!
AMY," For real, Boyle. That was some Superman stuff you pulled."
HOLT, You did the Nine-Nine proud.
JAKE," No ifs, ands, or butts. Sorry, it’s just right there. Literally -- your butt is right there, in my face."
CHARLES, I have to tell you guys something. Even though I got shot--
JAKE, In the butt. Sorry.
CHARLES," I’d rather be here, spending Christmas with all of you than on some stupid singles cruise. And I mean that from the bottom of my--"
JAKE," Butt, again sorry-- Ow."
ROSA," Shut up, Jake. Boyle’s a hero. And so is his butt."
AMY, Got it! You smiled! Holiday card complete!
JAKE," He got shot in the butt. Nooooo, strong lady"
Kake," [Knocks] Hey, Cap'n, got a second?"
Holt," It's ""Captain."""
Jake, What did I say?
Holt," ""Cap'n,"" like Cap'n Crunch."
Jake," All right, but to be fair, Cap'n Crunch was a war hero and the primary male role model in my house, growing up, so... Anyways, cap-tain, you know that jewelry store robbery down by grand army Plaza?"
Holt, Mm-hmm.
Jake," I know who did it... Dustin Whitman. I put him in Rikers two years ago. He just got out, and the crime scene matches his M.O. perfectly."
Jake," Okay, what do we got?"
Officer," Well, security cam shows a male suspect, 5'9""..."
Jake," Wearing a black ski mask. He bypassed the McConnell alarm by using the magnetic kill switch. And he only stole diamonds, nothing over two carats."
Officer," Yeah, exactly. How'd you know?"
Jake," I'm a Detective. It's what I do. I'm just kidding. I need a lot more information. But that would've been a great exit line, right?"
Jake," The crime techs aren't done yet, but I'm 100% sure it's Whitman."
Holt," Well, let's see what kind of physical evidence they turn up, and then we can talk arrest."
Jake," Actually, hilarious story. So that is Dustin Whitman. (WHITMAN SITS IN HOLDING)"
Holt," You already arrested him? With insufficient evidence? By law, we have 48 hours to find that evidence, or we have to let him go. You just started the clock."
Rosa, What's up with this emergency meeting?
Terry," Whoa, Detective Santiago."
Amy, Big date tonight. How do I look?
Jake," Well, I think you look... [Donkey braying] Sorry, that was supposed to be a catcall. I don't know how this works."
Rosa," Hey, is this why you were getting makeup tips from the prostitute in the holding cell?"
Amy, I just wanted to know how she got such smoky eyes. Turns out it was an STD rash.
Holt, Detective Peralta has made a collar in the jewelry store heist.
Charles," Way to go, Jakey."
Jake," Ah, that's okay."
Holt," No. He didn't get sufficient evidence to make it stick, so we have the next 48 hours to fix his mistake."
Amy," Damn it, Jake. What evidence did you have when you arrested this guy?"
Jake, Some pretty ironclad stuff.
Jake," Dustin, it's been a while. Mind if I ask you a few questions?"
Dustin," Well, well, well, if it isn't joke Peralta. [Laughs]"
Jake," That's it, you're under arrest."
Jake, Case closed?
Holt," If we don't find something conclusive, it jeopardizes the case and opens the department up to a lawsuit. So cancel your plans. We're here until this is over."
Amy," Damn it, Peralta."
Jake, Ow!
Holt, I know everyone's mad at Peralta for ruining their weekend.
Jake, But?
Holt, That was it. I was just demonstrating for Detective Peralta what a fact is.
Holt," Terry, you just pulled two doubles. You must be tired. I'll stay for this Whitman debacle. You go home."
Terry, I'm not tired. Why would you think I was tired?
TERRY," I ended up doing 25 minutes of sleep chin-ups on muscle memory alone. Tired Terry still gets after it, that's all I'm saying."
Rosa," Hey, Gina, can you order food for us at the Flatbush Diner? They make the best pies in New York City."
Gina," Oopsie, you said something super dumb. The best pie in the city's at Crust."
Rosa, Wrong. Ignorant and wrong.
Gina," Uh, you think you can just bully people, but you can't. It's not okay. I'm the bully around here, ask anyone."
Rosa," Boyle, you're always blogging on that foodie website. Which pie's better?"
Gina," Yeah, whose do you like better, mine or Rosa's?"
Charles," Oh, uh, you know, I-I haven't been to either place yet."
Gina, Why is your eye twitching?
Charles, [Scoffs] Wouldn't you like to know?
Gina, Could I see you for a second in the evidence lockup?
Gina," Charles, I know what's going on. You've tried both pies. You know mine is better. But you're scared to tell Rosa, 'cause you're into her."
Charles," What? [Laughs nervously] That is not true, okay? I-I-I don't even like food."
Gina, What?
Charles, Who's Rosa? Y-you're the scared one.
HOLT, Planning your strategy?
Jake," No, I'm just making funny faces at him. This mirrored glass is awesome. It straight-up works."
Holt, An effective use of your limited time.
Jake," It is, actually. That's how I got him last time. Let him stew for a little bit, got in his head, and he confessed."
Holt, You better be right.
Jake," I am. Hey, make some funny faces while I'm in there. I wanna see if I can tell."
Dustin," I didn't do anything, joke."
Jake," [Mouthing] That's funny. You said the exact same thing last time. And how'd that work out for you? Let's take a look. Okay. Here's you at your trial. You in prison. Me meeting Regis Philbin. That was fun. You still in prison. Me at Splash Mountain, just pepper these in here. You in prison, you in prison, you in prison, you get it."
Dustin, You got the wrong guy.
Jake, All right. Not ready to confess? Fine by me. I got all the time in the world.
Dustin," No, you actually have 48 hours. I know the law."
Jake, Nuh-uh.
Jake walks into the bullpen," So looks like we're gonna be here for a while. Should someone do a coffee run? You know what? Coffee's on me. Oh, but no froofy frappuccinos or anything, I've only got, like, 10 bucks. Okay."
Holt," Rise and shine, detectives, rise and shine. Peralta, I want you to bring everyone up to speed."
Jake," You slept in your office, and you look exactly the same. How?"
Holt, What are you talking about? My hair is a mess.
Jake," Oh, yeah."
Holt," Briefing room, five minutes."
Charles, How long were we asleep?
Terry," Just long enough for me to squeeze in quick workout. So, like, three hours."
Rosa, Morning. (ROSA WALKS IN SITH A COFFEE LOOKING GOOD)
Jake, Ugh. I can't believe you live nearby and you won't let anyone crash at your place.
Rosa, You people already know too much about me.
Jake," I know exactly three facts about you, and one of them is that you won't let any of us crash at your place."
Rosa, Is that a nightgown?
Terry, That's mine. It's a t-shirt from my fat phase.
Jake reads the shirt," ""If at first you don't secede, try try again."""
Terry," When you're that big, you buy anything that fits. A lot of fat guy clothes have racist overtones."
Jake," Okay, a couple of quick announcements. First, I met our night janitor Ronald. If any of you are missing hand sanitizer, he drank it. Second, our warrants finally went through. We gotta place Whitman at the scene and prove that he either possessed or sold those diamonds."
HOLT," I know you're all tired, but don't forget why we're here."
Jake, Because we're dedicated detectives.
Holt, Because Peralta jumped the gun.
Jake, Yep.
Holt, Get to work.
Jake, So we both had good answers.
Amy, This isn't a joke. You're ruining our weekend.
Jake," Okay, I'm sorry you had to cancel dinner with your dad."
Amy, Date. I had a date.
Rosa," Hey, if Jake says the guy did it, that usually means the guy did it."
Jake, Thank you. Everyone listen to Rosa.
Rosa," No, I'm still furious at you."
Jake," Okay, no one listen to Rosa. She's clearly an accomplice to this crime. I'm gonna go take another crack at Whitman."
Amy," You've been in there, like, five times. What are you gonna do? Annoy him into talking?"
Jake," Ha, ha."
JAKE WITH A GUITAR," Two, three, four. [Strumming guitar out of tune] Aah! [Shrieking]"
Jake walks in the briefing room handing Terry the guitar, Didn't work. Thank you. Did not work.
Jake," Hey, Captain. Will you please let everyone else go? I feel bad that I ruined their weekend, and I can tell they're pissed at me. I mean, Charles hasn't tried to high-five me all morning."
Holt," Yes, I've taken the brunt of that."
Charles, Kitchen buds.
Holt, Are you sure Whitman did it?
Jake," Yes, I'm positive."
Holt, Then the whole team stays. We have a better shot with everyone on it.
Jake," Fine, will you at least tell Hitchcock to go home? His mouth smells like rotten trout milk."
Holt, Is there such a thing?
Jake,'I'm just telling you what it smells like.
Holt, Get out.
Jake, Do you have the bank records?
AMY, Mm-hmm. Good thing I didn't reschedule my date for tonight. We're never leaving here.
Jake," Well, maybe that's a good thing, you know? Saved you from another lame internet date with some lame guy named Dirk or Mar... garine."
Amy," He's not lame, okay? He works with a friend of mine. He has a human name. And I'm not telling you what it is, because you'll look him up and make fun of him."
Jake, I can't believe you think so little of me that you would just automatically assume... Is it Luke Mueller?
Amy, How did you do that?
Jake," Well, you only have one friend... Kylie. And she has seven male coworkers. Goatee, goatee, jaunty fedora, profile pic is a sunset, Tasmanian devil tattoo, goatee. Leaving Luke as the only viable option."
Amy," Well, he's nice, and he uses proper punctuation in texts."
Jake, Dreamboat. And I wanted to go out with him.
Jake, All right. You know what? Reschedule for tonight. I promise I will get us out of here in time.
Amy, Fine. I'm holding you to that.
Rosa, Where's he taking you?
Amy," Terrific, let's get everyone involved. Dinner and a movie."
Rosa, [Farting noise] (Rosa walks away)
Amy, Dinner and a movie is the perfect first date.
Charles," I think the perfect first date doesn't feel like a first date at all, because you've known each other for a few years, maybe even work together. And one night you're laughing, and then all of a sudden, it's just like blammo! Kissing."
Rosa," For me: Cheap dinner, watch basketball, bone down."
Charles, So pretty much the same as what I said.
Rosa," None of the partials match Whitman. If he did it, he didn't leave any prints."
Charles, Maybe he doesn't have any. Interesting fact about me... I once burnt my fingerprints off on a wok.
Gina," Hi, hello."
Charles, What are you doing? Holt said you didn't have to come in here. You don't come in on days you're supposed to work.
Gina," Because I'm so nice, I brought two pies. One is from Crust. And one's also from Flatbush Diner. Hey, you know what might be fun? Charles could try them and tell us which one is better. How fun is that?"
Charles, So fun.
Gina," Yay! Yum, yum, yum. Yummy."
Terry," You got a second, Captain? I've got these overtime forms for you to s..."
Holt, Are you stifling a yawn?
Terry," No, sir."
Holt," Go home, sergeant."
Terry," I'm fine. And I filled this out. I just need you to... Permission to yawn, sir."
Holt, Go home.
AMY," Please, I'm begging you."
Jake,"  [Sniffs] Oh, fair enough."
Amy, Yeah. [Chuckckle]
Jake, That's for women. These your glasses?
Amy, Mm-hmm.
Jake, They're gigantic.
Amy," My contacts dried out, thanks to you. And they're cool."
Jake tries them on," No, they're not. Wow, you are blind blind."
Amy, Yeah.
Jake, You're a blind cop. How has there not been a made-for-TV movie about your struggles?
Amy, Give those back.
Jake," Yeah, okay. Wait a minute. I did it. I got Whitman, dead to rights."
Amy, I can still make my date?
Jake," As I promised. Go get changed. And by that, of course I mean throw your glasses in the garbage, then get laser surgery, then recuperate... And she left the room."
CHARLES, It's all right. 6 out of 12.
Gina, Out of 12? Why?
Charles," For the 12 components of food satisfaction: Salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami, odor, sound..."
Gina," Sound? Come on, Charles. Try her nasty pie."
Charles," Oh, wow. That's the best pie I ever had."
Rosa, [Laughs]
Gina," No, no. No, no, no."
Terry, What's this?
Charles, We were running calls to pawn shops and then waiting for them to call back.
Terry, I didn't ask what you were doing. I asked what you are doing.
Rosa," Pie taste test, it's over. I won."
Terry," That's unacceptable. If you wanna know which restaurant has better pies, you can't just have one guy try one pie from each place. Everybody needs to try all the pies from both places. We gonna be here awhile."
JAKE, Debit card statement. You were at a parking meter two blocks from the jewelry store an hour before the robbery.
Dustin," Oh, no, you found out... About my wife. We both have cards, because we share a joint account, because we love each other."
Jake," You're incapable of love, and I'll prove it! Oh, I'm very tired."
Dustin," I want my lawyer, now."
Jake, Ugh! You have changed. You used to go straight to prison!
Amy, Did Whitman talk?
Jake," Oh, he talked all right."
Holt, He asked for his lawyer.
Jake," By using words, which is technically talking. We can't ask him any more questions till we find his lawyer, and we can't find his lawyer anywhere. I'm sorry."
Amy," Aah, come on. Why is there pie here?"
Jake," That's not good. I think the world of you, as a colleague and friend."
Amy," Shut up, Peralta."
Jake, Yep.
Gina, Yes!
Terry, Another one for Crust. It's not looking good for Flatbush Diner.
Rosa," Ah, come on!"
Jake, You went home and showered? That's so unfair.
Charles, I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.
Jake," Oh, cool. Hey, can I borrow it?"
Charles," Uh, why do you wanna borrow the toothbrush?"
Amy, What possible answer could he give that would make you say yes?
Jake, I wanna brush my teeth.
Charles," Jake, it's been in my mouth."
Amy, That's the grossest thing I've ever heard.
Jake, That's the grossest thing you've ever heard? You caught a guy on the subway with a bag of human ears.
Amy, Your thing's grosser.
Terey, Bring out the meringues.
Gina, I brought a few more.
Jake, That's so many.
Terry," You wanted something, sir?"
HOLT," Look, it's impossible to make you leave. But you do have to sleep, and that's an order."
Terry," Sir, this is not necessary. Also, can't sleep without my whale songs."
Holt," Terry, I've seen this before. Problems at home, so you stay late at the job, but that only makes it worse."
Terry," Everything's great with my wife. It's just, my brother-in-law's in town, and we do not get along. He thinks I'm a weakling."
Holt, You?
BROTHER IN LAW, Let me get that for you.
Terry, I can do it.
BIL, Tiny Terry loves his pickles.
TERRY,'He makes me feel so small.
HOLT," Who cares what he thinks? You're a police sergeant. You're a grown man. Now take your nap. And if I see the lights on in here, I'm gonna be very disappointed in you."
Lawyer, Are you the idiot that made a Friday night arrest? I was in the poconos with my wife. You ruined my entire weekend.
Jake," Get in line, because that's their attitude. Get your own attitude."
Lawyer," He has an alibi, geniuses. He was at Torque. It's a nightclub in Cape May, New Jersey, all night."
Jake, Nice try. You think I'm gonna waste six hours driving to the Jersey Shore and back on some fake alibi?
Lawyer," It's up to you. But in ten hours, he walks."
Jake," More like in ten hours, he walks into prison, when we bust him."
Holt, Let's follow up on his alibi.
Jake," Yep, you heard him, Scully, hit the road."
Holt, No. You should've looked into this before you made the arrest. You go.
Scully," Oh, Captain, I'm happy to go. I love the saltwater taffy down there."
Jake, Scully loves the saltwater taffy down there.
Holt," No, Peralta's going. Go, Peralta."
Jake," Look, I know I caused this problem, but I can fix it. We just got some new security footage in. Let me stay here and go through it. I'm gonna prove that Whitman was at the scene of the crime, even if it kills me."
Jake, This is killing me.
Amy, Good. Die.
Jake," [Sighs] You know, if it does come to that, I have but one wish before I go. Can I please put your glasses on my pen1s? I just think that would be really funny."
Charles enters the copy room," Hey, can you make copies of these warrant requests for me? I'm not your secretary."
Charles, You're everyone's secretary. That's literally your job.
Gina, And your job is lying about your taste buds?
Charles, [Sighs] I'm sorry about the whole pie blowup thing. You're right. The Flatbush Diner pie is awful.
Gina, Thank you.
Charles, It's just... I want Rosa to like me.
Gina," All right, do whatever you want, but most women don't really like it when dudes lie to them. Except for me, but I'm wired to thrive on dysfunction."
Amy," Nothing. Wait, wait, wait. This guy... 5'9 "" or 5'10"", black knit cap. Come on, come on, come on."
Jake, Gotcha!
Amy," Ugh, it's not him. Let's just arrest this guy. Who even cares anymore?"
Jake, : So how'd my new best friend Luke take it when you cancelled on him again?
Amy," Don't know, hasn't called me back. Which is what always happens, because it's impossible to be a cop and date."
Jake," Amy, look. There is a guy out there with incredibly low standards and a super weird soul patch, and he is waiting for you. Amy, my patch tingles for you. We will wed on the isle of New Jersey. Our first dance will be to Jessie's girl, because my name is definitely Jessie."
Any, It's so romantic.
Scully," Hey, guys."
Jake, Hey.
Scully," Yeah, there's good news, and there's bad news. The bad news is my saltwater taffy place was closed."
Holt, And the good news?
Scully, Whitman's alibi checked out. Security footage from Torque shows he was there.
Jake, That's not good news. That's bad news.
Scully," Right. That is bad news. Sorry, it's on me."
Holt," No, Detective Scully, it's on Peralta."
Jake," No, Captain, that's on Santiago."
Jake, It's on me. It's still on me.
Terry, This is such a disaster.
HOLT," It's not good. D.A.'s furious. Whitman and his lawyer are in my office right now, gunning for a lawsuit."
Terry," No, not that. My brother-in-law is coming to have dinner with me on his way to JFK. But also the botched investigation, that's bad too."
Amy," Okay, what can I do?"
Jake," Oh, your services will not be necessary, because you need to go home and change for your date."
Amy, What?
Jake," I called handsome Luke. I explained the weekend was entirely my fault, partially. And he wants to go out with you tonight."
Amy," Thanks, Peralta."
Jake," You're welcome. Just promise me you won't use the condoms in the secret pocket of your purse, okay? They're expired."
Amy, How do you know what's in my purse?
Jake," I needed concealer for a zit. Plus, you know, we spend so much time together here, I know everything about everyone. I know Hitchcock went bald at 15. Scully used to date Hitchcock's wife. Charles has a bike with a little basket on the front. How else would you carry baguettes? And Rosa has a shower in her apartment, I think. I got nothing on her."
Rosa, Good.
Amy," Well, I guess we did just spend 48 hours locked in here together."
Jake, Holy crap.
Amy, What?
Jake, Locked in here together.
Lawyer, So we will be filing a wrongful arrest suit against the NYPD.
DUSTIN," And when I win, I'm gonna buy club Torque, put a statue of Jake Peralta right in the middle of the dance floor."
Jakw," First off, that's a terrible threat. I would love to have a statue of myself in the middle of a dance club. Second... [Clears throat] Do me a favor, take a look at this picture, and tell me what you see."
Dustin, You and Regis Philbin.
Jake," Awesome, right? Surprisingly down-to-earth guy and definitely not the picture I meant to show you. But take a look at this. That's right, it's you and your old cell mate Marcus Cole. And here he is again outside the jewelry store. The two of you planned this together in prison. You taught him your M.O, he pulled off the robbery, you got yourself an alibi, and you split the loot. Oh, man, I can't believe he caught us. [As Regis Philbin] Of course he did, Peralta is the best! Aw, thanks, Reg."
Holt, That's enough.
Jake," Yeah, I gotta work on my Regis. Anyway, see ya in jail, Whitman."
Holt, You got anything else to say?
Charles," Hey, Rosa, the Flatbush Diner's pie is terrible. It's inedible. Food is supposed to be edible."
Rosa," So you were lying? What the hell, Boyle?"
Gina, [Giggles] Put it in the suck-it bucket.
Charles," Crust isn't any better. It's fancier, but it's all bells and whistles. Desserts don't need to be clever. They just need to be good. This is the best pie in New York City... Apple from Argos Bakery, founded 1910. Recipe unchanged. Taste it."
Rosa," Damn, it is amazing."
Gina," This pie is so good, I hate it."
Charles," You just graduated pie school, bitches. Sorry I said ""bitches,"" I'm just really worked up."
Gina," Yow! Mmm, what is that?"
Jake," Sorry for screwing up everyone's weekend. Hey, uh, drinks on me. Who's in?"
Scully," Oh, no way."
Amy," No, I got the date. I gotta change."
Jake, Come on.
Holt," Everyone's tired, Peralta. They just wanna go home."
Jake," Yeah, but I have to prove I'm not selfish, so I don't care what they want. That sounded bad. And to make up for what I did, I'll cover one shift each for all of you."
Rosa, [Laughs]
Hitchcock, No kidding?
Jake, Except Santiago.
Amy, What?
Jake, I got you your date back. One nice thing from me is all you get.
Terry, So this is my desk.
Betrothed in law," Desk jockey, huh? You just sit here, eat your pickles, wait for the criminals to turn themselves in."
Terry," Actually, I don't like pickles that much."
Holt," Terry, I'm glad I found you. There's been a development in the Russian mob case."
Terry, Oh?
Holt," Yeah, our killer has been spotted in the warehouse down by the canal. Get your gear."
Terry," So you want me first through the door, sir?"
Holt," Oh, it's just you. The SWAT team is on another call, so you'll have to do it alone."
Terry," Hey, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight."
BROTHER IN LAW," Hey, no, do your thing, do your thing. Go, Terry."
Holt, You can crash on my couch. I even downloaded you some whale songs.
Terry," Thank you, sir. I'll never forget it."
Holt," Good night, Terry."
Jake," Oh, this is amazing. This is so amazing. Everything about this is amazing."
Terry, What are you talking about?
Jake," A virus got on the server and sent all of us an email with everyone's search histories. Check this out. Sergeant Jeffords searched the lnternet for ""undiscovered muscle."""
Terry, I was working out and saw a muscle in my shoulder I'd never seen before. I thought it might've been a scientific discovery.
Gina," Listen to this. Scully searched for ""how much fudge is in a calorie?"""
Scully," I never found the answer, but it was a good question."
Charles," Yes, I did, and I am thrilled with the results. Although the jar is really hot."
Jake," That's gross. And Amy searched for ""Daniel Craig hands"" plus ""close up."" Ugh."
Amy," You should talk. You searched for ""cheapest date possible."""
Jake, And I wear that search like badge of honor.
Jake," So, ready for dinner? Here we go. [Grunts] (Jake sticks his hand in the vending machine)"
Jake, Would you like something sweet? Or maybe savory? Apple pie... And I'm stuck. I'm stuck!
Jake," Peralta. Hey, Sal. To what do I owe the honor? Oh, my God. Yeah, we'll be right there. Boyle..."
Jake, No! I can't believe Sal's is gone. This place is an institution. It's the best pizza in the neighborhood.
Charles," Well, eighth-best. But yeah, a tragedy. I mean, any food-related crime is a tragedy. [Siren blares] Oh, no. Heads up, fire marshal."
Jake," Oh, Boone. What's that nimrod doing here?"
Boone," Hey, Peralta."
Jake," Hey, Boone. What are you doing here, you nimrod?"
Boone," Uh, there was a fire. Big question is, what are you doing here? What, did somebody call in a missing doughnut?"
Jake," Uh, actually someone reported they couldn't find your head. But we found it. It was up your butt. You're a fireman, you should know how to treat that burn."
Boone," Joke's on you, 'cause this is a fire, which means it is fire department jurisdiction. So why don't you back off and let New York's bravest handle it?"
Jake," You know they only call you that because ""New York's best at spraying stuff with water"" is too wordy."
Jake," Ha, well, it's too bad we all can't be as awesome as New York's finest, which by the way, sounds like my mom describing her dishware, which... and she's dead, so let's tread lightly on the response."
Jake," That's not fair. Yeah. Well, look, we heard this might be arson, so we wanted to check it out."
Boone," No, I'm not letting you onto my crime scene. Okay?"
Jake," All right, fine. You know what? You're not invited to our next murder."
Holt, Good solve on the Herman Avenue burglaries. Finish up the paperwork as soon as possible.
Amy, Your wish is my command.
Holt," No, that was actually a command. So my command is your command."
Amy," Well, then I guess you still have all three of your wishes."
Rosa, You're not a genie.
Amy, I know that. Okay. We're leaving.
Amy, What was the name of the clerk we questioned about the second burglary?
Amy," My last four dates were really boring, so I thought I'd mix things up."
Amy," Oh, wow. [Laughs] [Poof]"
Guys clothes disappear leaving him in his white underwear , Ta-da!
Amy," Oh, no."
Amy," What about you? Why were you looking for real estate in Ropesburg, New Jersey?"
Amy, Ropesburg P.D. Offered me a job as their new police Captain. I turned it down.
Amy,"!Oh! You... Captain. [Chuckles] Oh... that's super... Super cool. (Amy rolls away from rosas desk, only gets half way to hers and pushes herself to her desk, very awkwardly)"
Jake," If we're gonna figure out what happened at Sal's, we've gotta get past those firemen. We need access. How 'bout this? We light a bunch of fires throughout Brooklyn, and when the firemen go to ""fight the fires,"" we walk right into Sal's, the crime scene's ours."
Charles," Why do we want to start a turf war with the fire department? I feel very uncomfortable saying this to you, but it doesn't seem like it's worth it... Unless you think it is."
Jake," I do. Like I said, Sal's is an institution, and it's the best pizza in the neighborhood."
Charles," I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's is only the eighth-best. I put out a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email blast. Sal's has the fourth-best texture, ninth-best crust, twelfth-best cheese, and honestly, they're only seventh in mouth-feel."
Jake," ""Mouth-feel""? What is that?"
Charles," The inside of your cheeks are very sensitive. It's like the inside of your thighs, except with a tongue."
Jake," Ugh, God. Look, no, Sal's has the secret sauce recipe that puts all the other pizza places to shame. But more importantly, fire marshal Boone is incapable of conducting a crime investigation. All fire marshals are doofuses, but Boone is King doofus of doofus island."
Boone, Gasoline? I'm pretty sure that's water. Only one way to tell.
Jake, There were more ways to tell.
Jake, And he's their leader.
Terry," Captain, here's the mope who hacked our computer system. His mother turned him in. His name is Corey Park."
Corey, My name is savant.
Terry," His web handle is ""savant."" His people name is Corey Park."
Holt," Why'd you target us with your computer virus, Corey?"
Corey," I don't know, I was bored, and it was easy to break into your weak-ass system. It was like taking candy from a baby."
Terry, Why are you giving candy to a baby in the first place? Don't give candy to a baby! They can't brush their teeth!
Terry, I doubt I'll need Gina's help. I'm sure she's busy anyway.
Holt," Use Gina. She's my assistant, and she has something to offer. Trust me."
Terry," Man, don't be hacking into my stuff."
Charles," Uh-oh, Jake, firemen."
Jake, What are you two doing here?
Jake," Wow, it's like watching meet the press."
Jake," Well, that's unexpected, but... All right, fine, I'll..."
Jake, You sure?
Jake," All right, I don't care if it's not our jurisdiction, we're solving this."
Scully," Would you like me to, uh, file that for you, Jake?"
Jake," Just ask for the doughnut, Scully?"
Scully," Can I have the doughnut, please?"
Jake,'Yes.
Jake, [Sighs]
Jake," It's good to see you, Sal. I'm so sorry about the fire."
Sal," I can't believe it's gone, Jakey, all of it. The pizza oven. The first dollar bill I ever made. [Tearing up] The 7-up fridge."
Jake," Hey, it's gonna be all right. You'll rebuild."
Sal, The fire department's been asking a lot of questions.
Jake," Oh, fire department questions. Let me guess. ""Uh, what part of my face do I put food in?"" ""How do you count to one?"" ""What's air?"" [Laughs]"
Sal," They think I torched my own place. You know I wouldn't do something like that, right?"
Jake," Yeah, of course. But can you think of anybody who might've done it?"
Sal,'I could think of ten pizzerias that want me out of the game. That jerk Mario comes to mind. We share a delivery radius.
Charles," Mario is number ten overall in Brooklyn, and rising fast. He might've wanted to move up the ladder."
Jake, Of one foodie weirdo's personal pizza email blast?
Charles, Yeah.
Jake," Okay, we'll start with him, then we'll move on to the rest of your competition, see if anything suspicious turns up."
Charles, It'll be the perfect opportunity to update my rankings. Can we stop at home for a pizza bib?
Jake," No, Charles, we gotta go fast. Right, right,"
Charles, I'll just use my work bib.
Jake," No, no bib."
Jake,"'We're gonna solve this for you, Sal. Sit tight."
Rosa," The guy who did the safe in the second apartment, what was his name?"
Amy," Cone. ""C"" as in ""Captain."" ""O"" as in ""overlooked."""
Rosa, What?
Amy, Nothing.
Rosa," Yeah, I know how to spell cone."
Scully, Okay.
Amy," So, Ropesburg P.D. You know someone there?"
Rosa, Nope.
Amy, So you were looking for a new job?
Rosa,Nope.
Amy, Weird. They just offered you Captain without considering anyone else? Like Scully... Because he's got so many years on the force.
Scully panicked," Hey, guys, I think I put my gun in one of these boxes, and I don't know which."
Rosa, You have a problem with me that you want to talk about?
Amy," Me? No, I am just filing evidence, sir."
Scully, Found my gun. It was in my holster. My holster's on my butt.
Amy," Good solve, Scully."
Charles," Mario, this pie needs work. Good consistency on the crust, but the cheese-to-sauce ratio is a travesty. [Spits]"
Jake, Do you have to spit?
Charles," In a word, yes. Amateurs go tasting, they fill up, and they lose their palate by the third slice. I take this very seriously."
Jake," So, Mario... Let me tell you what I think happened. Your credit card transactions are down by 1/3 in the last six months. Meanwhile, over at Sal's, it was a bunch of smiling faces and happy stomachs. One night, you snapped. A little gasoline... fah! A little match. And poof! No more Sal's. How right am I?"
Mario," The night of the fire, I was at my father's funeral."
Jake, Oh... My condolences.
Charles, [Spits] Ugh.
Charles, Gino... This pizza is much better than last time. You've always ranked dead last in structural integrity and sauce.
Jake," But way more importantly, I did a little research, and it turns out you did six months in prison for a b&e."
Gino," I did. The night of the fire, I was at the prison giving a motivational speech on how parolees can turn their lives around."
Jake," Well, it's good to hear that the system works, and you are welcome. Have a good one. This is a dead end. We've gotta check out that crime scene."
Charles, Can't. Firemen locked it down.
Terry," Ah, you must be Simon Walker. Have a seat. It says here you were an I.T. Specialist with the board of ed for two years."
Simon," Well, I know my way around a computer, that's for sure."
Gina, Query: What's your favorite Jay-Z song?
Simon, I'm sorry? Favorite Jay-Z song?
Terey, [Chuckles] She's kidding.
Gina," Hmm. No, I'm not. What is it?"
Simon, I don't know.
Terry, I'm sorry about her. Okay. What's your experience with cyber-security?
Simon," Uh, well, I added encryption software..."
Gina," But seriously, what's your favorite Jay-Z song?"
Simon, I don't know! Big pimpin'? It's big pimpin'!
Gina," Mm, wrong answer, friend."
Another guy," And that's, um, how I got involved in, you know, systems analysis. I'm sorry. I'm really nervous."
Terry,There's no need to be nervous.
Gina," Yeah, we're all just calm, cool, collected... Wahh!"
Guy, [Screams]
Gina, [Laughs] Oops. Was that a little sudden?
Terry, What would you say is your biggest weakness as an employee?
Lady," Um... I'm sorry, what was the question again?"
Gina flossing her teeth says,"He said, ""what's your biggest weakness [muffled] As an employee?"""
Lady, That's just gross.
Gina," I'm sorry, I just have a skootch of gingivitis. So I'm trying to treat that as best I can. Sorry. You seem disgusted."
Rosa, Here's an itemized list of everything taken from the garden apartment.
Amy," TV, computer... ""Ster-b-eo""? Uh-oh, spelling error. That's not very Captain-y."
Rosa," Oh, my God, enough."
Amy," I just think that you meant ""stereo,"" not ""ster-b-eo."" Did you mean ""ster-b-eo,"" Captain?"
Rosa," That's it. Get in my car, now. And if you say another word, I promise you, you will regret it."
Amy," Aye aye, cap..."
Amy," Ow, okay. Fine, I regret it. Ah... I'll go. I'm going."
Jake, These firemen are not moving. We gotta distract 'em. Tell 'em your little boy's cat got stuck up in a tree.
Charles," Ooh, undercover work. I love it. I need more back story. First off, can it be my daughter's cat?"
Jake," Okay, but if you get made because of that, it's on you."
Charles," Fine. Let's talk about the cat. Short-hair, long-hair? Tabby?"
Jake," Short-hair, calico. The son is adopted. Your wife is in a coma."
Charles," Oh, that's brutal."
Charles," I like it. Hey, guys? Guys, I really need your help. My little boy, Brian, my angel, I bought him a short-haired calico after my wife fell into a coma... Motorcycle crash. And now the cat's stuck in a tree."
Charles, He's a cute kid. Kinda looks like you. Handsome guy. Handsome little guy.
Charles," Brian was adopted, so he has abandonment issues. Just struck out at tee-ball last week. Everyone called him ""cryin' Brian."""
Boone," Hello, Peralta."
Jake, Aah!
Boone, You looking for something? What is the deal with you and this second-rate pizza joint?
Jake," This place is a Brooklyn institution, and I'm here because you think Sal did it and you're wrong!"
Boone," He did do it! Sal was in financial trouble, he has no alibi, and in cases of arson, the owner always did it."
Firemen," What's going on, sir? What's going on is that Peralta has screwed with me for the last time, and now he's gonna pay."
Jake," Oh, you know what, Boone? Any time you want to..."
Jake," Well, that escalated fast. [Grunting]"
Charles," They're getting nervous, Jake! They're getting nervous!"
Charles," Get off him, Boone! You big marshmallow!"
Cop," Hey, break it up! Now!"
Fireman," Hey, hey, hey! Don't tell my guys what to do!"
Cop, Don't tell me what to tell people what to do!
Fireman," Well, make me not do it, tough guy."
Jake, Uh-oh.
Jake," Hey, break it up!"
Holt," I apologize, marshal Boone, for Detective Peralta's actions, something I find myself doing quite frequently."
Jake," In my defense, I was the only one saying we should stop hitting."
Jake, Stop hitting them! Kicking them will hurt more!
Boone," Okay, I'm a reasonable man, so I'm just gonna say this. Fire Peralta immediately. He started a fight. He overstepped his jurisdiction. And he's obsessed with this pizza place."
Jake, What I'm obsessed with is how you're bungling this investigation. They should write a song about it called welcome to the bungle.
Jake," Seriously, why are you dragging Sal's pizza through the mud? That place is special."
Holt, Why's it special?
Jake, Because it's the best pizza in the neighborhood!
Charles, Well...
Charles, Captain reads my blast.
Holt," Of course, it's the only one that measures mouth-feel."
Holt," What, are you kidding right now? This isn't about pizza. What's it actually about?"
Jake," When I was a kid, I was shortstop on my little league team."
Boone," Oh, my God."
Jake," It's the truth. It's not a brag. My dad was the coach, and after every game, he would take the team to Sal's. Halfway through our last season, he left me and my mom, and the worst part about it was that I couldn't go with him to Sal's anymore."
Holt," Well, that's certainly not what I expected this to be about."
Boone," [Crying] Sorr... I'm sorry. I'm sorry that happened to you. I mean, what kind of dad just... Just leaves his son like that? Look, you're... You're a cop and... And I'm a firefighter, but underneath all of it, we're just two boys whose dads abandoned them. And you and I, we're gonna solve this thing, together. Okay?"
Jake, Okay.
Boone, Okay.
Jake, Yeah.
Boone," But first, let's hug like men."
Jake," Oh, boy. This is happening. [Boone Crying]"
Boone," Captain, get in here."
Holt," There, there. There, there. There."
Charles, I'm coming in.
Jake," [Groans] Oh, Boyle."
Amy, What's going on? Did you drive me out here to kill me?
Rosa," I thought about it, but then I put that thought on hold. I wanted to show you Ropesburg."
Amy, This is Ropesburg?
Rosa," You wanted this offer so badly, I thought I'd give you a chance at the job."
Officer," Miss Diaz! Are you here to reconsider? We've bought the deputies bullets, like you suggested."
Rosa," Hi, sergeant. No, I'm still not interested. At all. But this is Detective Santiago. She's one of our top detectives, and she really wants the job."
Amy, I...[Chuckles] Yes. Can I ask what happened to the last Captain?
Rosa," He quit to start a carpet cleaning business, because that was better than being Captain here because this is the most boring place on earth."
Amy, [Chuckles] She doesn't mean that.
Officer, It's okay. It's true. Gotta be known for something.
Holt," So of all the candidates that you interviewed today, who do you think I should hire?"
Terey," Well, the interviews got a little off-track. But I'd go with Simon Walker. Computer science degree, worked for the board of ed for ten years."
Gina, That guy? No way. He yelled at me when I asked him the same question about Jay-Z three times in a row.
Holt, Why does that matter?
Gina, Because whoever takes this I.T. Job is gonna have to deal with Hitchcock asking how to log in to his email every single day forever. How do you think Professor short fuse is gonna handle that?
Terry," Fine, what about this guy?"
Gina," Mm, no. He was scared of everything. Do you remember Rosa's reaction last time the printer jammed?"
Rosa, I'll pay for that.
Terry," Fine, what was with the flossing?"
Gina," Mm, a precinct is a pretty gross place, ter-bear. There's blood, wounds, Scully's feet. You need a strong stomach, and that lady did not have one. Plus, we already have the perfect candidate already: Savant."
Terry, That punk who hacked us?
Gina," Precisely. Captain, turn your greatest weakness into your greatest strength, like Paris Hilton re: Her s*x tape."
Holt, Get to the point.
Gina," Savant tore our walls down, but he can build them back up, taller and thicker than ever."
Terry, But how can we be sure he won't turn on us?
Gina," His mom ratted him out, so I bet he'd love a steady paycheck to get out of that snitch's house. [Laughs] If I had a mic right now, I'd drop it."
Holt, There we have it.
Boone, And here's the file you wanted.
Jake," Well, it's hard to believe I'm gonna say this, because I've spent most of my adult life hating you and everything you stand for, but... Thanks."
Boone," I'm not gonna lie, my therapist is gonna be very proud of me."
Jake, That's weird. Any reason you can think of one of your guys would've forced this cabinet open while they were putting the fire out?
Boone," No, no. I can't. Looks like it was jimmied open with a crowbar."
Jake," Oh, my God. I know who did it. Come on, I'll explain it on the way down."
Boone," Wait, wait, wait. I can't believe I'm offering this to a cop, but... Do you want to take the pole down?"
Jake," Oh, my God, yes."
Jake going down the pole, Whee! Let justice be served. Did you get it?
Charles, Uh-huh. My turn?
Jake, Nope. No time.
Charles on the pole, Whoo!
Jake," We know you burned down Sal's, gino."
Boone, You hated him because his pizza was better than yours.
Gino, That's not true. Gino's pizza's always been the tastiest.
Jake," Wrong. According to Boyle's email blast, it was downright lousy before. That's what made it so suspicious when he suddenly loved it."
Charles, Much better than last time. [Spits]
Charles," The crust was charred, the cheese was stringy and flavorless, but the sauce. Oh, Marone, the sauce. Continue."
Jake," And that was your mistake. You didn't just burn Sal's down, you also stole his secret sauce recipe. Here's a picture of the cabinet in which said recipe was held. Busted open with a crowbar. (Shows him picture of the cabinet) Look familiar? Also, your so-called motivational speech down at the prison ended at 5:00 P.M., leaving you plenty of time to get back to Sal's and burn it to the ground. So I guess there's only one thing left to say."
Both," Gino Bianucci, you're under arrest... [Clears throat]"
Jake, Excuse me.
Boone, No. Do you mind? This is my collar... I think I can handle this. If I'm not wrong.
Jake," Yeah, but I actually did all the work."
Boone," See, I knew you would... You know what? Fine. Go ahead, I don't care. Gino Bianucci, you're under arrest for arson. Yes! Said it first."
Jake, Real mature. Very mature. Off we go.
Rosa, So what'd you think of Ropesburg?
Amy," It's, uh... quaint."
Rosa," It's whack, and you know it. Their number-one crime is tricycle theft. There's a bakery attached to the precinct. Come on, Santiago. You never would've taken that job, so why'd you even care that they offered it to me?"
Amy," I can't help it. I'm competitive. I have seven brothers, and I was the only girl. I always had to fight for a place at the table."
Rosa," Well, you're not the only girl at the table anymore. We work in a police force full of dudes. We gotta have each other's backs, okay?"
Amy, You saying you have my back?
Rosa," Yeah, I got your back. Don't smile. I'm still mad at you."
Amy, I thought we were having a moment.
Rosa, Moment's over. Shut up.
Hitchcock," Hey, sarge. He made my computer smarter. All I have to do is put my thumb on that thing, and it opens up all my electric mails."
Corey," [Laughs] You seem real smart, man. Oh, and look, and you play with toys."
Terry," Savant, you're part of the nine-nine now. We look after each other. Hey, ball, if savant was to do anything to harm this precinct, would I destroy him? (Terry crushes the 8 ball with his hand, Charles eyes are widen) Answer uncertain. Try again."
Holt," Peralta, fire marshal Boone just called. He told me you should check your drawer?"
Jake," Oh, look at that. I've been booned. Well, the joke's on him, because I was out of shaving cream."
Holt, I see we are once again at war with the fire department. You are not to retaliate.
Jake," Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, sir. In fact, I'm gonna send over a little peace offering: Some of Sal's famous sauce."
Jake," Now, Boyle! "
Charles, Fire! Fire! Fire!
Jake," Pleasure working with you, Boone. Run, Charles! [Laughter]"
Jake, Come on... whoa!
Firmen, Get that guy!
Scully," No! No, no, no! You can't take her from me, you b*st*rd!"
Hitchcock," Don't do this, Scully. You have to be strong for her right now."
Terry, What's going on?
Greg Gerg, Unit's being replaced.
Jake, That machine's been here forever. It's basically part of the force. Take Scully instead.
Scully," Yes, please, take me to the land of vending machines."
Jake, Can we at least have five minutes to say a proper good-bye?
Greg, Whatever.
Jake," Let me just start by saying that this machine is the best restaurant in Brooklyn, and it always had a table for me."
Rosa, I knew just where to punch it to get free food. Now I have to go back to punching Hitchcock.
Terry," Look, she still has the bags of baby carrots I requested they put in. They're black now, but they're there."
Jake," Good-bye, beautiful machine. Thank you for your service. Okay, squad salute."
Jake," You can take her away now. Well, I think we handled that with dignity."
Jake, Free candy!
Jake," Okay, Nine-Nine, say hello to Michael Augustine, Brooklyn's most prolific identity thief. Last week, he walked into a government building and stole a computer containing over 100,000 social security numbers. My C.I. says that tonight Augustine will be handing off the laptop to a buyer from China, AKA the Land of Dragons."
Holt, Make sure that phrase is not in your official report.
Jake," Okay, sorry, The Country of Dragons."
Holt," I want you and Santiago to tail Augustine until he makes the drop, and then arrest him and the buyer."
Jake," Sounds good, although I could probably just take Boyle. I know Amy has a ton of work, so... Amy: No, I don't."
Jake," Really? I could have sworn I overheard you telling Rosa, ""Girlfriend, please. I got hella open cases."" Amy: That's something you think I said?"
Jake," Word for word. No diggity, no doubt."
Holt, That's enough. Peralta and Santiago will tail Augustine. Boyle and Diaz will join them in a surveillance van unless you have a problem with that.
Jake," Sounds great. In the immortal words of Amy Santiago, ""Girlfriend, please."""
Amy," Hey, did I do something to you? Are you mad? Is this because I brushed all the crumbs off your desk?"
Jake," What? No, I don't care about that. Do you know where they are?"
Amy," In the trash. All right, if it's not that, then why are you trying to keep me off this case?"
Jake," Oh, that. All right, look, the reason that I didn't want to work with you is... should I do this in an accent so that I can undercut some of the awkwardness I'm feeling?"
Amy, No.
Jake," Good call. Remember when you told me that you didn't want to date cops? [in Jamaican accent] That really bummed me out, man. Jamaican? Yeah, it was a bad choice. I'm much better at German. [sighs] All right, fine. I was kind of thinking about asking you out."
Amy," Oh, okay."
Jake," But I know that that's not what you want, and I totally get it. I think it just took me a while to totally-totally get it, and now I totally get it."
Amy," Jake, this is weird. The whole point of me not dating cops is so it wouldn't be weird at work"
Jake," Okay, so let's just make it not weird, right? This is a case; we work cases together all the time, and we're really good at it, so, you know, we're professionals."
Amy," That's all I want, for us to be professional."
Jake, We're in agreement It will be good and professional.
Holt," Come in and shut the door. I have some news, which you must promise to keep secret. Madeline Wuntch is making me head of public relations for the NYPD. I'm being forced out of the Nine-Nine. I don't wish to make a big deal of it, so please limit your reactions to one second; go."
Terry, What in the world?
Gina, Are you kidding?
Holt, That's plenty.
Gina, You can't leave us.
Holt," I'm not going anywhere. Madeline's not some invincible succubus. She's a regular succubus, and she can be defeated. We just need to find the letter."
Terry, What letter?
Holt," Before our current police commissioner was hired, a mutual friend told me Madeline wrote a letter to the mayor telling him it was a mistake. She apparently called her now-boss a ""simpering buffoon""."
Gina, Amateur; always say your insults to someone's face. No paper trail.
Holt," A copy of that letter exists in the mayor's archives. I can't go snooping around without alerting Madeline, so it won't be easy, and we don't have much time, but I need you to find that letter. Are you with me?"
Terry," Oh, hell yeah."
Gina, I'm turning my phone into airplane mode.
Terry," Oh, my God, she doesn't even do that on airplanes."
Charles," Rosa, I know you don't like anyone wishing you a happy birthday, so crappy day to you."
Rosa, Still too much.
Charles, I assume you're not doing anything to celebrate tonight.
Rosa,  Anyone over the age of six celebrating a birthday should go to hell.
Charles," So since you're free, I need your help moving this old Ms. Pac-Man machine I just bought."
Rosa, Why are you so obsessed with that game?
Charles," Because it's the sexiest video game ever. She's insatiable, Rosa. Insatiable. Insatiab..."
Rosa," Stop saying ""insatiable."""
Charles," Anyway, I bought this old machine from a bar, and I was hoping you'd help me move it. You want me to go to a bar?"
Rosa, Mm-hmm. You are obviously trying to get me to go to a surprise party. Did Marcus put you up to this?
Charles," What? No, that's crazy talking. We just need to be there at exactly 9:45 p.m. and not a minute earlier. Also, there's a particular door I want us to enter through."
Amy, Why is he getting out here? I thought your C.I. said the drop was happening in a park.
Jake, Maybe he's having dinner with his sidepiece first.
Amy, Augustine has the laptop with him. We should just arrest him right here.
Jake," No, the buyer's the bigger collar. We've got to follow him in and wait for the handoff."
Charles," Okay, if you're going in, I've heard this place has an amazing bone marrow custard. [laughs] Not that I've ever had a bad one."
Jake," No. All right, let's go."
Amy," No, wait, we look like cops. We're never gonna blend in dressed like this. Okay, there, how's that?"
Jake," Uh, I don't know. All I see is clothes hanging off of a genderless blob."
Rosa," You look fine. Here, wear this. Jake, you need a jacket or something."
Charles," Well, Scully left his sports coat back there. Oh, but it will never fit Jake's athletic body. Unless..."
Jake," No, I don't want to do that."
Charles, You have to.
Jake, I'm not gonna do it.
Charles, You're doing it.
Amy, What? What do you have to do?
Jake, Don Johnson it.
Charles, Don Johnson it!
Jake, I look like an idiot. I didn't even have time to lotion my forearms.
Amy, It's so weird wearing Rosa's jacket. There's a piece of barbed wire in the pocket.
Jake," Cool. All right, do you have a visual on... the hostess stand? Hi. Table for two, please."
Hostess, I'm so sorry. There's nothing available. We're totally booked up.
Amy," Oh, no, that's horrible. Tonight's a really important night for us. Johnny and I just got engaged, and this is where our first date was."
Jake," Oh, yeah, it would mean so much to Dora and me. I would have made a reservation, but I didn't know if she was gonna say yes, so..."
Amy," Oh, I love how nervous you were, you little goose."
Hostess," You are just so sweet together. You know, I'm sure I can find room for two young lovers."
Jake," Yeah, we are lovers... together... in beds."
Amy, Okay.
Hostess, Thank you so much for waiting. Your table is almost ready.
Jake, Great.
Amy, Sorry about springing the engagement and romantic stuff on you.
Jake," No, no, no. That was great. I mean, it's what got us in here. Cheek kiss was a bit much. Very wet."
Amy," Well, I don't know what to tell you. Dora's sloppy."
Hostess,"Okay, and if you'll just follow me."
Jake," Well, the honeymoon's over, Dora. We're back to being Jake and Amy, two normal cops working a job."
Hostess," All right, there you go."
Jake, Thanks.
Jake," That's us, Johnny and Dora, a couple for sure."
Gina," Okay, according to my sources in the assistant community, the letter is right here in the fourth-floor archives, cabinet J-13."
Terry, Nice job. What's the plan?
Gina," You sneak in and get the letter. I'll distract the file clerk. Apparently, he's very into bird watching, so talking to a woman should blow his mind. And talking to this woman, it could kill him. Here, can you look at this map of a park and tell me where them hot birds hang out?"
File clerk," Well, you're gonna want to, uh, avoid the, uh, great lawn, because it's basically just grackles."
Gina," Ugh, grackles?"
File clerk, Yeah.
Gina, I hate grackles. They're the worst.
File clerk," Well, a lot of people think grackles are just a common bird up here, but you know what? On the West Coast they don't get grackles."
Gina, Can you give some more info for a novice bird watcher such as myself?
File clerk, You have got to know the difference between your water birds.
DOZERMAN," Hello. I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Seth Dozerman. My motto is simple: Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency."
JAKE, Could probably just say it once.
DOZERMAN, Are you making fun of my stutter? 
JAKE," Oh, uh... "
DOZERMAN," Tricked you. I don't have a stutter. Boom, I've already established my authority through my amazing sense of humor."
TERRY," Well done, sir. Welcome to the Nine-Nine. I'm Sergeant Terry Jeffords."
DOZERMAN," And I'm not interested. I have no use for people. I find people weird and confusing. I live my life by numbers. You see this watch? It tells me how many calories I burn at any time. Question: How many calories do you think I burned walking from there to there? You, female closest to me."
AMY," Oh, uh, three? "
DOZERMAN," Three? Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Try 0.8, numbnuts. I have made promises to my superiors that I most certainly cannot keep. That's why I need you idiots to work twice as hard. No, no, strike that. Four times as hard. No, no, no, strike that. I need you morons to work eight times harder than you've ever worked in your entire life! I'm having a heart attack. Yeah, I'm having a heart attack. Get back to work."
TERRY, Get a doctor! 
JAKE," Yeah, I'm just gonna make some copies in here. Perfect cover. Nailed it. So apparently, the new captain survived, and his heart attack not the craziest thing that happened at the precinct today. We kissed, like, three hours ago."
AMY," Yes, we did kiss each other, for reals."
JAKE," For reals-reals. Listen. I know you said you don't want to date cops, but I really like you. "
AMY, I like you too.
JAKE, Good.
AMY, But what if we start dating and it makes things weird at work? 
JAKE," So let's just keep it light and breezy, see where it goes."
AMY, Totally. Yeah. So how do we keep it light and breezy? I know. A comprehensive set of rules.
JAKE," How am I attracted to you? Doesn't matter, I am. Go."
AMY," Rule one, let's not tell anyone so we can figure out what this is first."
JAKE," Smort. Rule number two, let's not put labels on it. We're not boyfriend and girlfriend, we're just ""mrmmzeep"" and ""jinglebin."" "
AMY," Great. Rule number three, let's not have sex right away. "
JAKE," Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool...No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt. Good rule. No sex, good rule."
AMY," So, should we go out tonight? "
JAKE," Yeah, totally. Maybe 8:00, maybe 9:00. Doesn't matter. We're light and breezy."
AMY, Totally light and breezy. No! 
TERRY, Briefing room. Five minutes.
JAKE," Wow, very chill."
HOLT, Wuntch.
WUNTCH," Hello, Raymond. You're looking old and sickly."
HOLT," So nice of you to greet us, Madeline. I thought surely you'd still be crushed under that house in Munchkinland."
WUNTCH," Sticks and stones, Raymond."
HOLT," Describing your breakfast? I came out as a gay cop in the 1980s, so it's gonna take more than reassigning me to break my spirit. I'll turn this place around just like I did the Nine-Nine."
WUNTCH," I doubt that. Everyone, this is your new commanding officer, Raymond Holt. He's going to be with you for a long, long time."
HOLT," Thank you, Chief Wuntch. I'm excited to be back. I look forward to doing meaningful work, beginning with my eight-point plan for community engagement."
WUNTCH," Wonderful. But no new initiatives until you finish the meaningful work that's already in progress here. Could be a while, Raymond. They're trying to come up with a name for the NYPD's new pigeon mascot."
HOLT," Oh, no."
GINA, What? Naming a pigeon? How long could that possibly take? 
WUNTCH, They've been at it for months. I love my life.
JAKE," Holy Moses, he's alive."
DOZERMAN," So I want to explain what happened back there. I did not have a heart attack. The doctors have informed me that I have a genetic heart condition. My aortic valve is 16% too narrow, which lowers my life expectancy from 103 to 64."
TERRY," So sorry, sir. That's terrible."
DOZERMAN," Yes, it's depressing. They also informed me that I carry the gene for webbed feet, which is interesting, more than anything else. But, uh, when you stare death in the face, as I have, it really puts things into perspective, namely that I've been wasting too much of my time farting around! So that stops now! Say good-bye to the fun, hilarious, laid-back Seth Dozerman that you used to love. Boys, hand 'em out! "
ROSA, What the hell are these? 
DOZERMAN," ""What the hell are these?"" These are Dozer-pads. Each one is equipped with a GPS system and a countdown clock to remind you to complete a task every 55 minutes. It also has backgammon on it, which I could not delete but you are not allowed to play."
JAKE, What happens when the clock runs out? 
JAKE," Oh, that's fun."
DOZERMAN, Yeah. Your 55 minutes starts right...now.
ROSA," Sarge, I don't need to be monitored all day long. I'm not a toddler. This is stupid."
TERRY," I know you're not a toddler, because my toddlers know that ""stupid"" is a no-no word. Keep that Dozer-pad on you at all times."
ROSA," Fine, but I am gonna play the hell out of some backgammon. Watch me."
BOYLE," Bouche Manger. Oh, small plates, casual-chic ambiance, no free soda refills...Jakey's going on a date. Are you going on a date with Amy? "
JAKE, What? No. Why? 
BOYLE," Uh, because you guys just kissed on that mission."
JAKE," Charles, we just kissed 'cause we were undercover. That's it."
AMY," Yeah, it didn't mean anything."
JAKE," Not that it's any of your business, Boyle, but the person that I'm taking on a date is a girl from the gym."
BOYLE," What? Why is this the first time I'm hearing about her? Or that you go to the gym? Jake, avoid the weights. Nobody wants you turning into another Terry. Ugh."
TERRY, Hey. People like the way that I look.
BOYLE," Sure they do, big guy. Look, I can't believe you're gonna take some fitness floozy to Bouche Manger. You should be going with Amy. Right, Amy? "
AMY," Uh...Whatever, dawg. Date the flooze."
JAKE," See? It's never gonna happen, Boyle, okay? Because I find Amy repulsive, and she finds me extremely handsome. So stop pressuring us."
BOYLE," Oh, you sweet, naive boy. I haven't even begun to pressure you two. I've already written my best man speech for your wedding. Oh, I'm gonna need you to get married on a farm. A lot of my jokes rely on that."
JAKE," So here we are, officially on a date. Romantical date."
AMY," Yes, we are. No longer just colleagues. Dating. You got a haircut. It looks nice."
JAKE," Oh, thanks. You also got a haircut—at some point in your life. I'm sure that's not your baby hair. That would be crazy. But, uh, yeah, you look very nice."
AMY, Domo arigato.
JAKE, Do you speak Japanese? 
AMY, No.
JAKE," Oh. Uh, sorry. I think I'm feeling a little awkward."
AMY," Yeah, me too."
JAKE, How do we make it not weird? 
AMY, I know. Let's just get super drunk.
JAKE," Yes, great idea. Pardon me, ma'am. Could you please bring us four kamikaze shots? "
AMY, And four for me as well.
JAKE," Ah, I like your style. See, we can do this. We're back on track. We're keeping it light and breezy."
JAKE, So we broke a rule.
AMY, Yeah. I hope it wasn't a mistake.
JAKE," ""I Hope It Wasn't a Mistake,"" title of your sex tape. Title of our sex tape."
BOYLE, So how was the date with the floozy? We are not leaving these seats until you give me some deets.
JAKE," All right, fine. It started off a bit rocky, but it ended up being really fun."
BOYLE, Did you kiss? Did you french? 
JAKE," Boyle, I'm not gonna answer that. And no one over the age of 12 says ""french."" "
BOYLE," Oh, that's a yes. Oh my God, you had sex. I can tell because you're glowing. Ugh, Jake, no one wants to hear about your sex life."
JAKE, You just asked me repeatedly.
BOYLE," Because I was rooting for you and Amy, but now I can see you're super serious about this anonymous gym seductress. Ugh, I'm so sorry, Amy."
AMY, It doesn't matter to me. I'm—I would never date Jake. I work with Jake.
ROSA, I'd love to see you date someone from work. Your head would explode.
AMY, Your head would explode...because of how well I would handle it.
ROSA, Mm. Sick burn.
TERRY," Peralta, Dozerman says he wants to see you."
JAKE," Captain, everything all right? "
DOZERMAN," You tell me. According to your Dozer-pad, four of your coworkers have been gathered around your desk for the last 90 seconds. Also, someone named Norm Scully has been in the bathroom for the last 72 minutes."
JAKE," Oh, yeah, that means he's about halfway. But in regards to the coworkers, sir, I was telling them I wanted to get more work done, but all they wanted to do was talk about my dating life, knowing full well that my true love is efficiency. You know my motto, sir: cho's before hos. ""Cho's"" is ""chores.” What? "
DOZERMAN," I like you. I could tell from the moment I walked in here that we were one and the same: detail-oriented, love crunching numbers. Bet your apartment's immaculate. Could probably eat off the floor."
JAKE, And I do.
DOZERMAN, Yeah.
JAKE, Yeah.
DOZERMAN,  I'm gonna handle this for you.
JAKE, Okay.
DOZERMAN," I'm gonna send out a Dozerblast. Hey, everyone stop talking about Peralta's personal life. Dozerblast over."
JAKE," Well, thank you very much, sir, and might I just say that this has been a Dozerblast."
DOZERMAN, I saw what you did right there. Get back to work.
JAKE,  Okay.
HOLT," I know you've been working on picking a name for the pigeon mascot for, uh, several months now. I feel like you might need a breather, so I've prepared an eight-point presentation on community engagement."
WUNTCH," We'll get to your presentation, Raymond. It's on the agenda."
HOLT," Well, it says here it's scheduled ""after everyone leaves."""
WUNTCH," And not a minute later. Trent, Bryce, where are we with the name?"
TRENT, We've narrowed it down to two choices: Petey or Paulie.
GINA," With all due respect, that pigeon is clearly a Ray J. Hi. Gina Linetti, the human form of the 100 emoji."
WUNTCH, I'd like to hear Captain Holt's thoughts on a name.
HOLT, Very well. My thoughts are: who cares? 
WUNTCH," Give us a name, Raymond. Weigh in on this. It's your job now."
HOLT, No.
WUNTCH," A name. Petey or Paulie, which is it?"
HOLT, What does it matter? Why'd you even choose a pigeon anyway? It's a terrible mascot.
WUNTCH," Because they're a staple of New York, they're nonthreatening, and they're everywhere."
HOLT," They're carriers of disease, and they eat garbage! "
WUNTCH," Name the pigeon, Raymond! "
HOLT, You can't make me.
WUNTCH," I can make you, and I will. Name the pigeon. That's an order! "
HOLT, ...Paulie.
WUNTCH, Thank you. Was that so hard? 
JAKE," Yeah, I'm trying to find some evidence. I'm just gonna look in here. Another perfect cover. Two for two. Nailed it. All right, I talked to Dozerman and convinced him to outlaw all personal talk at work. We're in the clear."
AMY," And everyone hates you for that, but this is totally working, and no one knows."
JAKE, I know. It's the best. And you know what? I'm glad we broke the rule and had sex on the first date.
AMY," Me too, 'cause we're, like, really good at it."
JAKE," So good, right? "
AMY, Stupid good.
JAKE," It makes no sense. We're light and breezy. If we want to break rules, break rules. Like, what's another rule we could break? "
AMY, No making out at work.
JAKE," Okay, that's very flattering, Amy, but there are some rules that I shall never— "
AMY, Let's go.
JAKE, Okay.
TERRY, What's that noise? 
ROSA, I don't hear anything.
ROSA, What? I put it up there for safe keeping.
TERRY, Safe keeping? 
ROSA," Yeah. I had it on my desk, but I kept spilling coffee on it. Oops."
TERRY," Come on, Diaz."
DOZERMAN, You two have been in this evidence locker for—Hey! 
AMY, What? Nothing.
DOZERMAN, Nothing? You were just making out with Peralta.
JAKE," Ah, there's that candy bar wrapper I was looking for. Oh, Santiago, what are you doing here? "
DOZERMAN," So I guess it is hos before cho's with you, friend. Now I understand why nothing gets done in this precinct. The detectives are too busy frenching with each other, but you know what? Your little honeymoon is over! 'Cause as long as I'm here, you two are done! And I'm gonna be here a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long—Oh, this is a heart attack. This right here, this is a heart attack. Ooh, it's a big one. Ooh, ooh, ooh. "
AMY," Oh, oh, oh. I'm gonna get help."
JAKE," Sir, it's all right. We're getting help."
DOZERMAN, Okay. Tell my wife that I love her...work ethic.
TERRY, What happened in there? 
JAKE," Nothing. We were just working, separately."
AMY," Yeah, and then Dozerman just came in and died."
JAKE," Peacefully, like an old cat."
TERRY, Can you think of anything that may have caused Dozerman to be startled? 
JAKE, Ah... 
AMY," Nope. Uh, he might have been startled by how far apart we were standing."
TERRY," That seems unlikely, but obviously he had a ton of health problems, so, you know, this seems pretty open and shut. Do me a favor and pull the surveillance tapes."
JAKE," Right, the surveillance tapes."
AMY," Yep, because this is a police precinct."
TERRY, You two have something to tell me? 
JAKE," All right, fine. Detective Santiago and I may have been in there...snorking."
BOYLE," Yes! Oh! Wait. What about the gym floozy? Amy was the gym floozy. The gym floozy was under my nose the whole time. Oh, I am over the moon."
AMY, Okay.
BOYLE, Over the moon.
AMY, All right.
ROSA, So what is this? Casual? Serious? I need to know how to make fun of you. You guys dating? 
AMY, Yes.
JAKE, No.
ROSA," Oh, that's not good."
JAKE," I mean, yes. I just said no because of the rules. We said we weren't gonna tell anyone."
AMY," It's very new, and we're still figuring it out."
TERRY," Enough. Look. Terry loves love, but Terry also loves maintaining a professional work environment. As your commanding officer, I am very disappointed in both of you."
ROSA," So, Boyle…"
BOYLE, Mm.
ROSA," Let's go look at those surveillance tapes, yeah? "
BOYLE," Oh, absolutely."
GINA," Captain, I know this isn't my place to say, but Madeline Wuntch is here to see you."
HOLT," Actually, that's exactly your place to say. You are my assistant. What precisely did you think your job was?"
GINA, Ideally? Bullfighter. But it's such a boys' club.
HOLT, Hmm.
WUNTCH," Ooh. I like what you've done with your office, Raymond. It's cozy, like a shoebox one buries a dead hamster in. So what did you want to see me about? "
HOLT," I'd like to propose a truce. Our feud is getting in the way of the NYPD's business. Madeline, the PR department is a joke. Their work here is meaningless. Nine weeks to choose the name Paulie. I knew instantly it should be Pepper, Officer Pepper O'Pigeon. "
WUNTCH, Maybe we should start the whole naming process all over again.
HOLT, I could turn this department around if you'd let me. You're wasting my talents.
GINA," This man is a Timberlake, and you need to stop treating him like a Fatone."
WUNTCH," Yes, yes, perhaps you're right. Perhaps I am wasting your talents. I want you to spread your wings, as it were. I think we've found the perfect person to wear the pigeon costume. It's you, Raymond. Do we need to get the costume altered, or do you have your own pigeon pants? "
HOLT," No, Madeline, I don't have my own pigeon pants."
TERRY," I know. Get off my back, computer ghost."
ROSA," Why are you still playing with that stupid game, Sarge? The guy is dead."
TERRY, It's not a game. I'm following our captain's orders.
ROSA," His orders were stupid. I hated him more than any cop I've ever known. Whoa. I just realized I'm never gonna be able to say that to his face. I mean, I could say it to his wife at the funeral, but it won't be the same."
TERRY," He was trying to make our precinct better. Look. Holt's gone, Dozerman died. Who knows who we're getting next? I'm just trying to keep this place running. That's my job. Case cleared! Yeah, how do you like me now, sucker? I mean, I hope you found peace."
JAKE," Hey, so everybody knows about us now, which means all the rules have been broken and nothing bad happened."
AMY," Nothing bad happened? Terry yelled at us, and we killed our captain. Jake, is this a bad idea? It seems like the universe is sending us a lot of signs that we should hit the brakes. Hasn't exactly been light and breezy."
JAKE," Yeah, it's been a little more stressful and death-y."
AMY, You have to admit it hasn't started out great.
JAKE," What do you want to do, then? Go back to being colleagues? "
AMY, Yeah. Maybe that's what it needs to be right now.
JAKE, Okay.
AMY, Okay. Sorry.
BOYLE," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no…"
JAKE," Boyle, can we please just go to dinner? "
BOYLE," No, no, no, no, no! This is not how you and Amy are supposed to end. You're supposed to grow old and die holding each other as your cruise ship slowly takes on water."
JAKE, What do you want me to say? We tried really hard. We made rules. We kept it light and breezy.
BOYLE, Light and breezy? 
JAKE, Ow! 
BOYLE," Light and breezy is how you describe a linen pantsuit, not a relationship you care about."
JAKE, We were just being cautious.
BOYLE, Cautious? 
JAKE, Ow! 
BOYLE," You guys started this with one foot out the door. That's what doomed you, not the universe."
JAKE," Actually, it makes a lot of sense. Ow, I was agreeing with you! "
BOYLE, I'm sorry. I'm just so excited about all this! 
JAKE," All right, so what do I do? Tell me."
BOYLE," Easy. You march over there, you tell her how you feel, and you bring a fancy bottle of lavender shampoo, because shampooing a woman's head is the most erotic thing you could ever possibly—"
JAKE,"  No, no, no shampoo. That's the worst. But I am gonna go over there. I'm gonna tell her how I feel."
BOYLE," Yes! Go get her. No! Wait till it starts raining. No, that's crazy. Go now."
JAKE, Okay. Ahh! 
AMY, Sorry! Sorry.
JAKE, It's okay.
AMY," I was home, and I really wanted to talk to someone about us and Dozerman and about Holt being gone, and then I realized that the only person I want to talk about that stuff with is you. So screw just being colleagues, and screw light and breezy, right?"
JAKE, Definitely.
BOYLE," Guys, we did it. We really did it."
AMY," Oh, Charles is here."
JAKE, Big time.
GINA, Captain. The kids want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is. I told 'em he got sucked up into an airplane engine. Is that all right? 
HOLT," I can't put that pigeon head on, Gina. Wuntch has defeated me. This is how it ends, with me standing on the urine-soaked floor of an elementary school bathroom in a third-rate bird costume. I quit."
GINA," No. I did not follow you to PR to watch you quit. I followed you because you're great and because you make everything you touch better, and I figured PR would be the easiest path to launching my reality show, ""Linetti, Set, Go."" "
HOLT," I thought your reality show was to be called ""Gina in a Bottle."" "
GINA," No, that was my fragrance line. Keep up. Listen. You cannot let Wuntch defeat you. That is not who you are. You are a person who will go out there and deliver his eight-point plan on whatever, whatever. "
HOLT, Community engagement.
GINA," Whatever. Even if the only people listening are a bunch of second graders, because Captain Raymond Holt never gives up! "
HOLT, Inspiring words. I'm going to give that speech. Help me with that pigeon head.
GINA," Yeah, all right."
HOLT, Let's blow some tiny minds.
TERRY," Wow, Diaz. That's the first time I've seen him smile."
ROSA, I didn't do it for him. I did it 'cause it's my job. We cool? 
TERRY, We're cool.
ROSA, Good.
TERRY," There's a rumor the new captain'll be here today. Now, I don't know who Wuntch is sending us, but it doesn't matter, because we're a family, we're strong, and together, we can do anything. Nine-Nine! "
ALL, Nine-Nine! 
VULTURE," What's up, ding-dongs? I'm your new captain."
JAKE, The Vulture. No.
ROSA, Still hot.
VULTURE," Now, I know we have our history, me vulturing your cases, me telling you to eat my farts, but that's all in the past, 'cause now that I run this precinct, things are gonna get much, much worse. So suck it."
JAKE, No!
TERRY," Okay, squad, the funeral's at 3:00, followed by a reception at Shaw's Bar. I want you all on your best behavior."
VULTURE," Yeah, and all eyes are gonna be on us because Frick and Frack here killed Captain Dozerman."
JAKE," Hey, we accidentally startled a man with a genetic heart condition. If you really think about it, his parents killed him."
VULTURE," All right, whatever. Look, there's a horse race going off in Dubai. I got serious money on it. Dismissed."
JAKE," Oh, yeah, we should all check out that race. God. He is the worst captain we've ever had. He drew boobies on my bulletproof vest."
ROSA, He stared at me for 90 seconds while he ate an entire peach.
AMY," He heard that I speak Spanish, and he made me fire his housekeeper. She was Polish."
BOYLE, At least he doesn't practice his crane kicks with you.
VULTURE, I said not to move!
BOYLE, I didn't move.
AMY," Listen, guys. Jake and I were talking last night."
BOYLE, Pillow talk alert! Set the scene. Spooning or face-to-face? 
JAKE, Charles.
BOYLE, Spooning.
AMY," Anyway, we came up with a plan. Jake is going to...befriend the Vulture so he lays off of us."
JAKE," It's true. I'm gonna bro down with him. If everything goes according to plan, we should be beer pong doubles partners by the end of the week. Now somebody get me a puka shell necklace. I'm going full douche."
JAKE," Okay. Hey, 'sup, bro?"
VULTURE,"  'Sup, Jake? "
JAKE, Got a little update for you on that Deberg assault case. Turns out the victim's wife was super hot.
VULTURE," Yeah, I read the file. She's a mom. Not interested."
JAKE," True that. So listen, I've been thinking. We got off on the wrong foot here. And I believe it's 'cause we're just too damn similar."
VULTURE, You do? 
JAKE, Absolutely. We both love premium tequila…
VULTURE,  Yeah.
JAKE, Robin Thicke...
VULTURE," Oh, yeah."
JAKE, Gots to have my puks.
VULTURE, Gots to.
JAKE," And of course, nip slips."
VULTURE," Let me ask you a question, Jake. You also like Okinawan martial arts? Because you left this in my back."
JAKE, Hmm? 
VULTURE," What I'm saying, Einstein, is that you stabbed me in my back."
JAKE, How so? 
VULTURE, Busted. I knew that you were faking it. I'll bet you don't even like nip slips!
JAKE," So, what, you bugged the briefing room? "
VULTURE," No, Scully butt-dialed me yesterday and he still hasn't hung up."
JAKE," Once again, Scully's butt is the downfall of this precinct."
VULTURE," Look, Jake, I know that you and Santiago are trying to take me down. You guys go home, you lay in bed together, you plot against me. Well, no longer. I want you to dump Santiago, and that's an order."
JAKE, What? You can't do that. It's completely against the rules.
VULTURE," Okay, Sonia Sotomayor. I would never break the rules. But what I could do, for totally ""unrelated reasons,"" is have you busted back down to a beat cop."
JAKE," No, don't do that, all right? I can learn to love nip slips."
VULTURE," No, you either love them, or you don't. It's too late. You dump Santiago, or you kiss that detective badge good-bye. Beat it."
GINA, First time back in the Nine-Nine.
HOLT, Mm.
GINA," I really miss these people, the whole crew. Jake, Terry, bleh. I forget all their other names."
HOLT," Just remember, we're here as PR representatives. I don't wanna be disruptive."
GINA," Too bad. We're like rock stars to these people. They're gonna go nuts, just like hah! Haah! "
HOLT, I would hate it if these doors opened and everyone stopped working to applaud us.
GINA," Hmm, nothing. You must be loving this."
HOLT, Yes.
AMY, What? He's ordering us to break up?
JAKE," Look, we can deal with this. We just need a new plan."
AMY," I got it. We lie, tell him we broke up, and then date in secret."
JAKE, Great! And you'd be okay lying to your captain?
AMY," Okay, new plan."
JAKE, Uh-huh.
AMY, Captain Holt is here today.
JAKE," Yes, genius! He loves us, and he's got tons of sway in the department."
AMY, He'll tell the Vulture to back down.
JAKE," Yeah, he'll be all ""Vulture, I must insist that you desist."" "
AMY," I really think this is gonna work. Also, if you ever want to bust out that Holt impression at home, I'd be okay with that. "
JAKE," Oh, okay. Duly noted, super disturbing, but I'm definitely gonna do it."
BOYLE," Hey, G-spot! "
GINA," Rosa, Charles, oh, I missed you guys so much."
ROSA," Really? 'Cause when you left, you made a pretty big deal of deleting us from your phone."
GINA," Girl, that was just the showman in me. PR is so boring. I need some Nine-Nine drama, stat."
ROSA, I don't think we're that dramatic.
GINA," I've been gone one week. Jake and Amy are dating, and they've killed a person. Come on, Charles. You got to have something weird and tragic going on."
BOYLE," Nope. Not unless you call hooking up with a girl at a funeral ""weird and tragic."" "
GINA, Home run! 
BOYLE," Her name is Lieutenant Singh. She's super hot. We were seated next to each other two funerals ago. And there was hard eye contact all through ""Danny Boy."" Last funeral, we made out in the parking lot. This time...something naughty this way comes."
ROSA, Ugh. What do you even know about this person?
BOYLE,"  Oh, we don't know anything about each other. She says she likes that about us. It's just pure animal attraction."
ROSA, This is creepy and unlike you. You even know her first name? 
BOYLE," Oh, um, do animals in the wild know each other's names? Look, all I know is, Charles Boyle is going to that funeral, and he's going to put the ""bone"" back in boneyard."
HOLT," Hmm, strange to be on this side of the desk."
VULTURE," Why? Oh, right, you used to work here. You know I made a lot of improvements since you left? I got a fridge for my protein shakes. I got a kettlebell station. I got a wolf that I killed in Utah. "
HOLT, I'm fairly certain that's a dog. 
VULTURE," Yeah, it was dark."
TERRY," Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to sign these—Captain Holt! I didn't realize you were here."
HOLT," Sergeant Jeffords, hello."
TERRY, Welcome back.
VULTURE," Hey, you know, I'm gonna stop you right there. Hugs are a form of inappropriate workplace touching. Trust me, I'm very familiar with the sexual harassment guidelines. That'll be all."
HOLT," Well, I won't take up too much of your time. Because the Nine-Nine was Captain Dozerman's last  precinct, you will be seated at the front of the funeral. I wanted to alert you that there'll be press, cameras—"
VULTURE," Whoa, whoa, whoa, cameras? Crap, nobody said anything about cameras. I got to rock the bells. There we go."
HOLT," Oh, I noticed in the bullpen that you had changed the case numbering system. I found, when I was commanding officer, that—"
VULTURE, I'm gonna stop you right there. You're not commanding officer anymore. 
HOLT, I was making a suggestion.
VULTURE," Yeah, look, you did a lot of good for this place while you were here, which is great for me, because I get to take credit for it. But you're not a real cop anymore. You're a desk jockey. This is my precinct now. And the sooner that you accept that, the better."
HOLT," Yes, well, I know my way out."
VULTURE, 'Cause you used to work here. I keep forgetting. Everybody does.
JAKE," Well, well, if it isn't Captain Raymond Jacob Holt. It's great to see you back at the Nine-Nine, sir."
HOLT, Yes.
JAKE," There it is, that classic Jake-Holt banter, zingers just flying around. It's like you never left."
HOLT," No, I most definitely left."
JAKE," Okay. Well, I know how much you love hot goss, so you probably heard Amy and I have been dating."
AMY, And we would love your approval.
JAKE, No. But that's not what this is about. 
AMY, It sure is not.
JAKE," Sir, the Vulture is out of control. All right, he told me if I don't dump Amy, he's gonna demote me. You got to help us."
HOLT," Let me stop you right there, Peralta. I'm not the Chief of Detectives. I'm not the Vulture's boss. I'm just some guy in PR."
AMY, But we thought— 
HOLT," I can't save your ass. I don't work here anymore. And the sooner you accept that, the better."
JAKE," Well, looks like somebody's got a bad case of the funeral crankies."
TERRY," Okay, guys, I know Captain Dozerman was a nightmare and that none of us liked him. But I'm gonna need all of you to pretend like you're sad. Everyone make a sad face. Scully, you are nailing it! "
SCULLY, My wife just texted. She's leaving me.
TERRY," Good, use it. Now, anyone seen Captain Holt? He seemed a little down when he came in. "
GINA," Yeah, he let me choose the music on the way over here, which leads me to believe he's given up on life."
TERRY," I got to go find him. Now, be respectful and grieve your asses off."
SCULLY, I don't know why this is happening.
TERRY," Scully, I love it! Everyone follow his lead."
AMY, So what are we gonna do about the Vulture?
JAKE, I've got a new plan. Pretend like we're talking.
AMY, We are talking.
JAKE, Exactly. It's working already. Now I'm going to coolly run my hands through my hair. Look where my elbow's pointing.
AMY," It's Davis Garmin, Chief of Detectives. Holt said he could overrule the Vulture."
JAKE," Exactly. The only question now is, will he believe us? "
AMY," Yes, 'cause we're gonna take a page from the Vulture's book."
JAKE," ""The Big Book of Small Butts""? "
AMY, What?
JAKE,  It's the only thing I've ever seen him read.
AMY," No, we're gonna secretly record the Vulture telling you to dump me. Then we'll play it for Chief Garmin. Then— "
JAKE, We're gonna totally have sex on top of each other.
AMY, You get to keep your job.
JAKE," Yes, that."
GINA," Ooh, Charles, your jump-off is here."
BOYLE," Hello, Lieutenant."
BOYLE," Yes, real tragic."
BOYLE, I've been doing lunges in the shower.
ROSA," Well, this got upsetting real quick."
GINA, I want to live in this moment forever.
BOYLE," I'll meet you, all right. M-E-A-T. Still think it's creepy? "
GINA, Yes.
ROSA," Charles, it is not like you to have sex with a total stranger."
BOYLE, Really? Tell that to me in an hour when we've had sex 23 times.
TERRY," There you are. You okay, sir?"
HOLT,"  No. Until this morning, some small part of me still believed I would be captain of the Nine-Nine again. What a fool I was. I should never have returned. It's like visiting your childhood home and seeing it's been replaced by a denim pants store. "
TERRY," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, sir. You didn't even stop and sniff the bouquet. You always sniff the bouquet."
TERRY," Maybe the old Holt did. But the new Holt chugs Beaujolais from a Burgundy glass without a care. Oh, it's a Sauternes glass. Look, the alcohol has rendered me a simpleton."
TERRY, Maybe you should just call it a day.
HOLT," I can't. I've been asked to deliver a toast here after the funeral, a message of hope. This is what I have so far: ""Pain."" That's it."
TERRY," One tweak: maybe you should lose the word ""pain,"" and then get in a cab and go home."
HOLT," Maybe I will. But first, you're gonna have one drink with me, Sergeant. For old times' sake? "
TERRY," One drink, and then we go."
HOLT, One drink.
TERRY, My tolerance has really changed since I had kids! 
JAKE," Hey, Captain. I was looking for you inside."
VULTURE, One thing I won't do is fart in church. This is God's house.
JAKE,"  Oh. Respectful. So listen, remember when you said to me that I have to dump Santiago or else you're gonna bust me down to beat cop? "
VULTURE," What I remember, Jake, is you pretending to be my bro and me being like, ""I'm onto you, dillweed.”"
JAKE," Oh, uh, sorry, could you say that one more time? I couldn't hear you over the bagpipes. Ugh, one second. Excuse me, could you stop playing that? Just trying to have a conversation."
BAGPIPE PLAYER," I'm warming up, man. Sorry."
JAKE," Yeah, I know. We just need two minutes."
BAGPIPE PLAYER," No can do. The funeral's about to start. Everyone wants to hear me honk, so…"
JAKE,"  Do you really need to warm up, though? I mean, you're just gonna make a terrible wall of sound."
BAGPIPE PLAYER," First of all, that's offensive to me as half Scottish. Second of all, you think you could do better? Blow my bag."
JAKE," Look, we just need a couple of minutes to chat. That's it."
BAGPIPE PLAYER, I'm not gonna stop playing until you blow it.
JAKE," All right, just give it to me. All right? Prepare to hear me play the bagpipes perfectly. "
BAGPIPE PLAYER, Okay. Oh my God.
JAKE, Point proven.
VULTURE," Yeah, I think I've heard just about enough of this catfight. I'm out."
JAKE," Wait, Captain! Sir! "
VULTURE," Your boyfriend—sorry, your ex-boyfriend—is pathetic. You should be glad that I ordered him to dump you. Swish. Kobe."
AMY, Got it.
JAKE," Yes! You're amazing! That was ""We Are the Champions."" "
JAKE," Ugh, it's impossible to find Garmin with everybody mourning all over the place. It's like they have no respect for our sneaky plans."
AMY," I know. Oh, look, there he is."
JAKE," Oh, great. Hi there."
OFFICER," Sorry, this area is reserved for close personal friends of the deceased."
JAKE," Ah, well, that is us. Dozerman and I were pretty much besties. Went on an annual fishing trip together. Cayuga Lake, caught a lot of Coho salmon. We are both so bummed that he's dead."
AMY, Super bummed.
OFFICER," Oh, right on. Come in."
JAKE, Thanks. Blessings to you.
AMY, Blessings? 
JAKE, I don't know. It's my first time in a church.
AMY," All right, how did you do that? "
JAKE," Simple detective work. There was a floral arrangement up front with a picture of Dozerman and 30 of his friends holding a big fish. Cayuga Lake, I pulled straight from the guest book. "
AMY, And Coho salmon? 
JAKE," Well, that's just something I know about from being a man of the world."
WAITER, Our special today is Coho salmon on a— 
JAKE, Sounds disgusting. Do you have chicken fingers?
JAKE, Impressed? 
AMY, Mm-hmm. And horrified by your eating habits.
JAKE," Well, if I'm so unhealthy, how come I never go to the bathroom? Okay, let's get to Garmin."
AMY, Yeah.
MARGARET," Hi, I'm Margaret Dozerman. How did you know my husband? "
JAKE," Oh, Mrs. Dozerman, your husband was a great man. Some of my fondest memories of him were on our fishing trips."
MARGARET, You went on those trips?
JAKE,"  I did, indeed. They called me ""the Coho King."" Pretty much single-handedly organized those things myself."
MARGARET, So you were the one who brought all the prostitutes? 
JAKE, Uh... 
BOYLE," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can we slow down? "
BOYLE," No, no, no. My friends are just in my head. They think it's weird that we don't know anything about each other."
BOYLE," Totally. I'm glad we're not interested in each other as human beings. Oh, how about if you tell me things about yourself and then I tell you how little I care about them? "
BOYLE, Not interested.
BOYLE, Who even asked you?
BOYLE, I don't care what you like. But maybe you could tell me one more thing.
BOYLE, She's a vegan! 
ROSA, What is going on? 
BOYLE," You're right. I couldn't help myself. I wanted to know about her. And I got what I deserved: a vegan, a gluten-free vegan! "
GINA," Charles, you need to calm down."
BOYLE," No. You called it, Rosa. So go ahead. Laugh at me! Laugh! Laugh it up! "
ROSA, Can I wait till after the funeral?
BOYLE, Of course you can.
TERRY," Sir, my life stinks. Sharon's on bed rest. My favorite mango yogurt got discontinued. And my kids think their preschool teacher's a stupidface."
HOLT, Everyone I work with is a stupidface. Especially Bryce.
TERRY, Sir? 
HOLT, Hmm?
TERRY, Sir? 
HOLT, Hmm? 
TERRY, Sir? 
HOLT, Hmm? 
TERRY, Can I be honest? Precinct's not the same without you. The Vulture's the worst. My mango yogurt— 
HOLT," Yes, you already mentioned the yogurt."
TERRY," 'Cause it's important! When I saw you in the office this morning, I wanted to give you the biggest hug."
HOLT," But the Vulture told you not to, and you had to listen. He's your captain now, Terry."
TERRY, I hate going to work and you're not there. Everything is garbage.
HOLT," Hmm. ""Everything is garbage."" I should put that in my message of hope."
TERRY, That's a really good idea! 
MARGARET, It took my husband and me years of counseling to get over those little backwood orgies of yours. He had sex with five prostitutes in one weekend.
AMY, Ugh!
JAKE, That's bananas! I had no idea. I was probably too busy praying.
MARGARET, You said you planned the trips.
JAKE," Yeah, I did say that."
MARGARET, Ca0lled yourself the Coho King.
JAKE," All right, look. I'm not the Coho King. My name is Jake. And your husband was only my captain for, like, a day."
MARGARET, Wait a second. Are you the Jake that killed him? 
JAKE," No, I'm prostitute Jake. I love prostitutes."
MARGARET, You need to go. You should leave right now. You need to leave right now.
GARMIN," It's okay, Margaret. Come on."
JAKE," Oh, Chief Garmin, wait, I just need to play you one quick recording of my boss."
VULTURE," You recorded me? That's not cool, Jake."
JAKE," Well, we were just taking a page out of your book."
VULTURE," Yeah? What are you gonna do next, huh? Are you gonna start wearing leather bracelets, hmm? Good luck pulling off that chunky-B with those skinny little girl wrists of yours. Congratulations. You're no longer a detective. You're a beat cop again. I just crushed your dreams."
JAKE," Okay, I know things seem really bad right now, but we just need a minute to think. [Bagpipes] Come on, man! "
JAKE," Okay, so the Vulture has your phone. But new plan— "
AMY," Jake, we've had lots of plans, and none of them have worked."
JAKE," Yeah, but this is a good one. The new plan is: no plan. We wing it! Probably won't work, but I said it with a lot of confidence."
AMY," Jake, you got demoted. We said this relationship wasn't gonna get in the way of our careers, and it has."
JAKE, So what? We'll figure it out. I'll make my way back to detective.
AMY, Or maybe you won't. I'm not gonna let you throw away your dream job.
JAKE," Amy, this is good."
AMY, This is a six-day relationship. We don't know what it is.
HOLT, And now for a message of hope.
JAKE," Ah, a message of hope, right on time."
HOLT, Everything is garbage.
JAKE," Oh, no."
HOLT," You find something you care about, and it's taken from you: your colleague, your dream job, your mango yogurt."
TERRY, Whoo! 
HOLT, Never love anything. That's the lesson. To Captain Dozerman.
ALL, Captain Dozerman.
JAKE," Thank you, sir. I'll take it from here. Very poetic. If I might offer a counter-toast of sorts. Captain Dozerman and I, we weren't together for very long. In fact, as coworkers, our relationship was only six days. But that's not nothing. It was long enough for me to know that we had something special. And sure, there may be obstacles. Him having passed away, for example. But I'm not giving up on us. And I don't care if I get demoted. I just care about being with you...Captain Dozerman, an adult man who has passed into the nether world."
TERRY," Move over, Peralta! Move over! Okay. And if I may do a third toast. It'll be focused primarily on the mango yogurt. Don't boo me! I lost something important too, shoot."
JAKE," Thought I might find you here. So not a big fan of my speech, huh? "
AMY," No, I loved it. I mean, I wish it hadn't been at a wake. And I wish you hadn't kept referring to me as your dead boss."
JAKE," Yeah, it pretty much sucked butt...but still was somehow the best of the three toasts."
AMY, Hmm.
JAKE," Look, I don't want to break up. But I don't want to get demoted either. I just don't know what to do. I'm all out of plans."
HOLT, I have one. Holt saves your ass.
JAKE, Captain.
HOLT," I was moved by your speech, Peralta."
JAKE," Thank you, sir. That's very nice of you to say."
HOLT, The syntax was problematic.
JAKE,  Less nice.
HOLT, And your vocabulary is a true indictment of the public school system.
JAKE, Seems like you're just slamming me now.
HOLT," But the fact that you're not willing to give up in the face of adversity is inspiring. I love the Nine-Nine, and I'm not gonna turn my back on the squad. So I fixed your problem with the Vulture."
JAKE,  Really? 
HOLT, I may just be a guy in PR. But what does the Vulture love more than anything? 
JAKE, Garbage Pail Kids?
HOLT,  No. Publicity.
HOLT," Captain Pembroke, how would you like your face on the NYPD website? "
VULTURE, Really? Yes! Yes! 
HOLT," In exchange for media attention, the Vulture will not bust you down or stand in the way of you two dating."
JAKE," Sir, I don't know how to thank you."
HOLT, Anything for the Nine-Nine.
AMY," Thank you, sir. He totally approves of us."
GINA," Whatcha doing there, Boyle? "
BOYLE, Trying to get drunk enough to have sexual intercourse with a vegan. Why can't I just think with my junk like a modern man? 
ROSA, Why do you want to do that? 
BOYLE," I got divorced, and I was crushed. My fiance left, I cried for weeks. My only relationship that wasn't totally devastating when it ended was my casual sex carnival with Gina."
ROSA," Yeah, okay, But with of those relationships made you happiest before it ended? "
BOYLE, My marriage. Vivian.
GINA," Yeah, because you connected with them emotionally, something we did not do. Because I'm a higher level of being, like Her from the movie ""Her."" "
ROSA," Dude, you can't go through life trying not to get hurt. You should try to be happy."
BOYLE, So you think I should look for someone I can have emotional intercourse with.
ROSA," I wish you hadn't said it like that, but yeah."
BOYLE, And I should start right here at this funeral.
GINA, I'd probably wait.
BOYLE," Nope, no time to lose. Put on your sunglasses. I need to see if there's anything in my teeth."
ROSA, Ugh.
BOYLE," Oh, yeah. Charles Boyle is ready for love."
ROSA," Well, never wearing these again."
JAKE," Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to start clapping, 'cause I just made a major drug bust. Talking about four kilos of cocaine, $200,000 cash, and my new partner, a tarantula. I call him Jake Jr., AKA Spidey Klum, Aka Mrs. Doubtspider, AKA Joe Spiden, AKA Tarantula Basset, AKA Spi-dermot Mulrooney. "
BOYLE, AKA Tarantulina Jolie.
JAKE," What? No, Charles, have you seen this spider? That's a terrible name."
BOYLE, Sorry.
TERRY, Why do you have that thing?
JAKE,"  Because they were gonna throw him away, but I couldn't do that to my furry little—ah! He's actually really scary up close."
TERRY, It's horrifying from everywhere. Terry hates creepy crawlers.
AMY," Seriously, I'm not going to your apartment if that thing is there."
JAKE," All right, fine, then he'll just live here and help me solve crimes. Get used to him, everyone, 'cause me and this spider are partners for life. He's gone. I left the cage unlocked, and he's gone. "
AMY, Somebody find him! 
BOYLE, Stay off the ground! 
ROSA, I'm good.
TERRY, I'm out of here.
JAKE, He couldn't have gone far...Unless he can fly. Can tarantulas fly?
TERRY," Jake, you better find that spider. And I'm not coming back here until you do."
JAKE," Uh, Sarge, I think I found it."
TERRY, Why are you looking at me like that? It's on my head! [Screams]
JAKE," A whole hour until we testify. Hey, donut holes. Don't mind if I do. Ugh! Fish? Fish donuts, Boyle? What is wrong with you? "
BOYLE," It's takoyaki. I'm drowning my sorrows in octopus balls. I've been online dating; It's a total disaster. I've only had one match, and it was a pretty obvious catfish situation."
YENNIFER, My name Yennifer. You give me social security. 
BOYLE," Oh, Yennifer…"
JAKE," Now, I see that as a positive story. Out of all the identities he could have stolen, he chose yours, and you want to know why?"
BOYLE, Because I posted my annual income? 
JAKE," Because you posted your annual income, you moron."
GENEVIEVE," Excuse me, is that takoyaki? "
BOYLE," Yeah, from Senka, right down the street."
GENEVIEVE," Oh, I love that place. The chef lets me take octopus hearts home for my dogs."
BOYLE," Oh, lucky! How many dogs do you have? "
GENEVIEVE," Oh, too many. Three."
BOYLE," That's how many I have! All right, wait, quick question. How do you keep them off the bed? "
GENEVIEVE, I gave up. I sleep on the floor.
BOYLE, Me too.
BOTH, It's better for your back.
JAKE, Wow.
BOYLE," Well, nice meeting you."
JAKE, What are you doing? She's walking away.
BOYLE," I got nervous. She eats octopus balls, and she sleeps on the floor. She's the perfect woman."
JAKE," Oh my God. Sorry, I was aiming at somebody else, but now that I have your attention...Charles? "
BOYLE," He was aiming at a terrible cwim—criminal, he probably saved the world. Do you want to have tak-takoyaki at the um, on the bench over there? "
GENEVIEVE," Sure, I was hoping you'd ask."
JAKE," My work here is done. Ugh, still fish. Oh, God."
HOLT," Santiago, thank you for coming in. It's no secret the NYPD has an image problem."
AMY," Yeah, when I told my garbage man I was a cop, he said, ""Gross."" He had someone else's band-aid stuck to him."
HOLT," Police approval ratings are,pardon my language, in the commode. All the headlines are about the bad cops, but there are good cops too, and I want to put up posters that showcase some of our best. I'd like you to be on the first one."
AMY," Shut up, Ray. I mean, interesting, Captain. I'll think about it."
GINA," Wow, this is a bad idea. First off, Amy has an epic lack of swagger."
AMY," Uh, I'll have you know I have swagger. I ooze swagger."
GINA," Right. More importantly, putting up a bunch of photos of smiling cops isn't gonna change how people feel about us."
HOLT," I think this campaign is very promising. Santiago, what's your take? "
GINA," Oh, right, let's hear an unbiased opinion from your straight-up swimfan."
AMY," I think it's a great idea, sir."
GINA," Well, you can count me out. I will not pose for your posters."
HOLT," I didn't ask you, and you're not a police officer."
GINA," Yeah, I'm out."
ROSA," Sarge, permission to arrest Hitchcock and Scully."
TERRY," I told you before, it's not harassment unless you can prove intent to fart."
ROSA," No, it's not that. They robbed me. They ate my Moose Tracks ice cream."
TERRY, That's funny. I wouldn't think you like Moose Tracks.
ROSA, My boyfriend Marcus introduced me to it. What? It is a delicious treat for all ages.
TERRY," Damn, Rosa, okay. Look, I think they've been skimming people's desserts for weeks, but I can never prove it. Did you see them take your ice cream? "
ROSA," No, but Hitchcock has fudge stains all over his chest."
TERRY, He's always got fudge stains all over his chest.
ROSA, Ugh.
TERRY, They'll deny everything. We need hard proof.
ROSA, So let's get it. Step one: Put a delicious pie in the fridge and cover it with poison.
TERRY, That's step one? What's step two?
ROSA, Tell their widows they were thieves.
JAKE," Hey, where'd she go? You guys were hitting it off. I half expected to see you sitting in her lap by now."
BOYLE, She is amazing. Her palate is wide and deep.
JAKE, Gross.
BOYLE," And at one point when she wasn't looking, I snuck a whiff of her hair."
JAKE, Of course you did.
BOYLE," She uses one of my top three shampoos: Tahitian coconut, extra lather."
JAKE," Sounds good, Boyle. Did you get her number? "
BOYLE," Oh, we lost track of time. She had to go back into court. When she's done, I'm gonna ask her out."
JAKE," Oh, okay, okay. So what's the plan?"
BOYLE, Going straight from here to the spa. Couples massage.
JAKE," Okay, seems a little intense, but given how your other weirdness lined up, I say go for it. Oh, here she comes."
BOYLE," Oh, okay. How do I look? "
JAKE, You look great. I've got a good feeling about this.
BOYLE," Genevieve, I know we just met, and I don't want to be too forward— "
JAKE, Charles.
BOYLE, But sometimes you just get a feeling about a person.
JAKE, Charles.
BOYLE, And I've got that feeling about you. I like you—
JAKE," Charles, look down."
BOYLE," I think tonight we—oh, shoot."
GENEVIEVE, They just gave me ten years in prison.
JAKE, She didn't say no.
JAKE," Hey, buddy. Got you some of those fish donuts you like so much to cheer you up. Although, full disclosure, I couldn't find where they sold them, so that's just a chocolate éclair with lox on it."
BOYLE," Oh, thanks, Jake, but I don't need cheering up. You can eat it yourself."
JAKE," Nope. So, what, you're not upset about falling hard for a lady who was immediately thrown in jail?"
BOYLE," No, because she's not actually guilty. They say she robbed her own art gallery for the insurance money, but that makes no sense. She would have made more if the art had sold. This piece, ""Breastfeeding Knight,"" was worth twice what she got from the insurance company."
JAKE," Wow, look at that. Not to sound overly intellectual, but dem knight boobies is crazy. I get art."
BOYLE," Also, I talked to Genevieve's lawyer. He's a total disaster."
BOYLE," I have a couple questions about a beautiful client of yours, Genevieve Mirren-Carter."
LAWYER, She got hit by a tow truck and sued the driver? 
BOYLE," No, she was accused of insurance fraud."
LAWYER," Oh, good, because I blew that tow truck case. Straight-up forgot to go to court."
JAKE," Well, they found one of the stolen paintings at her house."
BOYLE, But she said she didn't know how it ended up there. She's being set up.
JAKE, Framed. Art joke. Continue.
BOYLE," My hunch is that it's a jealous ex-lover. A girl like that, three dogs, makes her own turkey stock, that's the kind of woman you don't get over. Look, I know you think my judgment's clouded because I like her a little bit— "
JAKE, You doodled your wedding invitation.
BOYLE," No, that's our joint tombstone."
JAKE, My mistake.
BOYLE," But as a cop, I really don't think that she did it. Something is off about the case."
JAKE," Okay, Boyle. I trust your gut. Let's go free an innocent woman."
BOYLE," Nice! My dreams are coming true. You and me, getting my lady off together."
JAKE," I mean, you know how that sounds, right? "
HOLT," Look strong, but fair. But approachable. But professional. And fun. But not too fun. This is your job. Can you handle all that? "
AMY," Sir, ""fun but not too fun"" was my campaign slogan when I ran for prom queen."
HOLT, Did you win?
AMY, No.
GINA, Ames? I want to say you look great.
AMY, Thank you.
GINA," You didn't let me finish. Dot, dot, dot, for you. Great news is, it doesn't matter, because this campaign, like three out of five Backstreet Boys, is inconsequential."
HOLT," That's enough, Gina."
GINA," All I'm saying as a, if not the, voice of the streets is, this tisn't gonna work."
HOLT," And all I'm saying as a, if not the, boss here is, if you're not gonna support me, you can leave."
GINA," Fine. I will leave. I'm gonna go get a mani-pedi, and I'm gonna do some serious subtweeting, so you might want to keep off the net."
TERRY, Diaz. Look what I found in Hitchcock and Scully's trash can: Ice cream spoon.
ROSA," Son of a bitch. You hungry, hungry hippos ate my ice cream. Why was this in your trash? "
TERRY, And who throws away a spoon? It's the easiest utensil to clean.
SCULLY," I don't even think it's ice cream. It's probably medicine. You know, I'm on lots of medicines, Rosa. I'm sick all over."
TERRY," This is ice cream, and I'm gonna prove it."
ROSA," Sarge, no. It's been in their mouths."
TERRY, What am I doing? 
HITCHCOCK," Well, I guess your little investigation has hit a dead end."
ROSA, I'll be back. Don't move.
SCULLY, Not a problem. I hate moving.
TERRY, Let it go. Let it go.
BOYLE," Interesting. Yeah, something definitely doesn't add up. Did you know there's a sausage you can drink? "
JAKE, What? Are you even talking about the case? 
BOYLE," We got distracted. She has an amazing tongue. Strong, supple, great bud density. "
JAKE," Okay, I'm gonna take over the questioning."
BOYLE," Yeah, I'm too close to this."
JAKE," Disgusting eating habits. Hi, Genevieve. I'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions now, and Detective Boyle will just sit there and keep waving at you, I guess. Now then, is there anybody you can think of besides yourself that has access to the gallery after hours? "
GENEVIEVE," No, just me, and the vault is only accessible through fingerprint ID. Does Charles have a girlfriend?"
BOYLE,  I just saw her mouth my name. What did she say? Is she asking if I'm circumcised? 
JAKE," What? No. Who asks that? Stop interrupting. Sorry about that. Okay, next question. Can you think of anyone that might be trying to set you up? Maybe an employee or a rival of some kind? "
GENEVIEVE," Maybe my ex-boyfriend Nick. He's an artist, a terrible one. He was always in debt and begging for money. That's why we broke up. Maybe he's resentful."
JAKE, Dirtbag ex. 
BOYLE," Oh, that was my theory, remember? Tell her it was my theory."
JAKE, Okay.
BOYLE," Wait, give me a second. I want to look smart when you say it."
JAKE," Okay. Uh, hey, Genevieve, Detective Boyle wanted me to let you know that he, a college graduate, had a similar theory that it could have been an ex-boyfriend."
GENEVIEVE, Wow. He is so smart.
JAKE," Wow, it actually worked. I've got to hand it to you, buddy, whatever you're putting down, she is picking up."
BOYLE," Oh, good. Oh, one more thing. "
JAKE, Boyle has another question.
BOYLE," Tell her when this is all over, I'm gonna rub her body in paté, and then rub it off her with a cornichon."
JAKE, I'm just gonna give the phone back.
BOYLE, Okay. Hi.
BOYLE," Guard got nauseous, so we had to stop."
JAKE," Hmm, that's weird. Do you think it's because you're the two most disgusting people in the universe?"
BOYLE,  Could be.
JAKE,"  Yeah, check this out. Remember the ex-boyfriend that she mentioned, Nick? "
BOYLE, Call him Mr. Butthead.
JAKE," Okay, well, apparently Mr. Butthead just bought a brand-new gallery in Dumbo to showcase his art, which is weird, because Genevieve said he was always in debt. Looks like somebody just came into a ton of money."
BOYLE," Oh, and you think she's gonna want to get back together with him now that he's rich. Damn it!"
JAKE,"  No, Boyle. He probably got the cash from selling the stolen art. Your hunch was right."
BOYLE," Yeah, it was. My hunch, my hunch, my lovely case-y hunch! Come on, Jake, sing with me."
JAKE," That's not gonna happen. I will literally never— whatcha gonna do with all that hunch, all that hunch inside your brain? "
BOTH," We're gonna solve, solve, solve this case, solve this case right in your face! "
JAKE, We should probably leave this prison.
BOYLE, Yep.
JAKE," Okay, here's my cover. My name is Sherwin Lemonde, sculptor, painter, full-time barista. But once I sell my first piece, part-time barista."
BOYLE," Oh, nice. I'm Donald Hoberman-Seitz. I wear glasses."
JAKE, Is that all you got?
BOYLE," Sorry, I spent the cab ride here imagining me and Genevieve kissing."
JAKE," Okay, just let me do the talking."
DVORA, Wine? 
JAKE," Yes, thank you so much. Oh, wow, I love your outfit. I'm an artist, so I get that it's more than just tight."
DVORA, Nick likes to coat women in latex. He's fascinated by the idea of the human chrysalis in society's pupation.
JAKE," Hmm, cool. Human chrysalis and whatnot."
BOYLE," Yeah, whatnot. It's a whatnot."
JAKE," Yeah, yeah. I have no idea what a chrysalis is, but serious question: If she farts in that thing, does it blow up like a balloon? "
BOYLE, You have to assume that it would.
JAKE," You have to, right? "
BOYLE, Yeah.
JAKE, Art is so intense.
BOYLE, It really is.
JAKE," Look, there's Nick. Hey, man."
NICK, Hey.
JAKE, Is this your work? 
NICK, Yes.
JAKE," It's good. I haven't talked to anyone here, but it almost seems like you're going for a human chrysalis thing."
NICK," I'm glad you like it. I wish I could take credit, but this is society. I'm just holding up the mirror."
JAKE," Hmm? Wow. You meant that literally. Very cool. Anyhow, I'm a fellow artist named Sherwin."
BOYLE, I'm Donald Hoberman-Seitz. I wear glasses.
JAKE," So anyway, I was wondering. How'd you get your own gallery? It must be really expensive."
NICK," Art's not about the money, man."
JAKE, Totally. It's more about the...other things.
NICK, Right on.
BOYLE," This painting is called ""Genevieve 416."" What's that all about? "
NICK," Well, April 16th was the day my ex, Genevieve, and I covered ourselves with paint and made love on that canvas for 24 hours straight."
BOYLE," That's pretty pathetic, dude. You seem pretty obsessed with Genevieve, huh? "
NICK, Excuse me? 
JAKE, Donald.
BOYLE, I bet it really hurt when she dumped you.
NICK, What? 
JAKE," Donald, your glasses."
BOYLE," Where were you July 21st, Mr. Butthead? "
NICK, Uh... 
BOYLE," Uh, duh, uh—You were robbing Genevieve's gallery. You framed her, and I should arrest you right now."
NICK," What are you, cops? "
JAKE," What? No, we're artists. And as artists, we question everything, including certain people's whereabouts on particular dates."
NICK, Get out of here.
BOYLE," Fine, but we're taking this, because you don't deserve that memory."
NICK," That painting is $95,000."
BOYLE, I don't want it anyway. Your penis was on it.
JAKE, Sorry about that. Donald is...sucks.
ROSA," Hey, you dum-dums. Ice cream. Moose tracks ice cream."
SCULLY, How do you know? 
OLIVER," Yep, it's definitely ice cream."
TERRY, Knew it! 
OLIVER," Also, whoever used this spoon...their body ain't right."
SCULLY," Okay, let's say it is ice cream. But I didn't eat it; I couldn't have. I'm lactose intolerant."
HITCHCOCK, Me too. I'm super lactose intolerant.
TERRY, You're lying.
HITCHCOCK, Have you ever seen us eat dairy? 
TERRY, You know no one can bear to watch you eat.
HITCHCOCK, Check.
SCULLY, And...check.
TERRY," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
JAKE," I got to say, Boyle. Nick was pretty defensive."
BOYLE," Yeah, and he's a terrible artist. All he does is have sex on canvases. Any fourth grader could do that."
JAKE, But...They shouldn't.
BOYLE, No.
DVORA," Hey, Nick doesn't like cops, but he didn't do anything wrong."
JAKE, And how would you know? 
DVORA," I'm his assistant, Dvora. He would never set up Genevieve. He's still in love with her. He keeps boxes of her old stuff lying around."
BOYLE," Ooh, can we look at, smell, and handle them? I mean, you know, for the investigation. We're cops."
DVORA," Please, take the boxes. I want them out of here."
JAKE," Oh, okay, great. You wouldn't happen to know where he was on July 21st, would you? "
DVORA," Actually, I would. He did a performance art piece that entire month. He lived in a cage on the street and never left it. The whole thing's on video."
JAKE," Okay, great. Totally. We'll just go around back and pick up the boxes. Oh, one more thing. Where in this ""cage"" did he go to the bathroom? "
DVORA, Bucket.
JAKE," Okay, gross. Have a good night."
AMY," Sir, I saw my poster on the subway this morning."
HOLT," Well, you must feel like a celebrity. A regular Ira Glass."
AMY, They put a Hitler mustache on me.
HOLT," Yes, this is unfortunate, but let's not overreact to one graffito."
AMY," It wasn't just one. People drew on every single poster. They put devil horns, target on my face, this one says, ""die pig,"" and worst of all, they didn't put the comma between ""die"" and ""pig."" "
HOLT, This is easily dealt with. I'll just issue a statement saying vandals will be prosecuted.
AMY," It's not just vandalism, sir. People have real complaints too. ""End stop and frisks.” “Stop racial profiling.” “Unlawful arrest is a crime."" "
HOLT, I see.
AMY," I think Gina was right about the campaign, sir."
HOLT," Hmm. I'm surprised she hasn't marched in here to say ""I told you so."" "
AMY, She wouldn't do that.
GINA," You're right, Amy. For once in your life, you're 100% right. I would never say that. "
HOLT, Yes.
GINA," Okay, good."
JAKE," Yep, it's true. He sat in a cage for a month."
BOYLE," Ew, the bucket checks out."
JAKE," This is insane. Anything is art. Here, watch this. A statue of Jesus made out of cigarette butts. Boom, I'm a millionaire."
BOYLE, That's actually pretty good.
JAKE," I know. And I could call it ""Holy Smokes."" Should we really do this? No, right? That's crazy; you can't just become an artist out of nowhere."
BOYLE, Jake.
JAKE, What? 
BOYLE, The case.
JAKE, Yeah.
BOYLE, So Nick has an alibi. That's not great. But we have a box of Genevieve's stuff from the gallery. I'm sure there's something in here that will exonerate her.
JAKE, Right.
BOYLE, Oh my God. Socks and shoes. This is exactly the type of stuff I own. This is kismet.
JAKE," Oh, no, what's this? It's a receipt for a storage unit that she didn't tell anyone about."
BOYLE, It's probably nothing.
JAKE," Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm sure it's nothing. It's totally nothing."
JAKE, It's a bunch of stolen art.
JAKE," Hey, buddy. Sorry about Genevieve."
BOYLE, It's okay. I'm resigned to my life of solitude. Just me and my five dogs.
JAKE," Wait, I thought you only had three dogs."
BOYLE," I just adopted two online right now. Oh, this pit bull hates kids. That's fine; I'll never have any. Add to cart."
JAKE," Okay, let me just grab that. Listen to me, Charles. You're gonna be fine. There are plenty of women out there. Strong, beautiful, smart women. How about her? She's very beautiful."
BOYLE," With my luck, she's probably a car thief."
JAKE," Don't be ridiculous. Hey, Scully. "
SCULLY, Yeah? 
JAKE, Who's the babe? 
SCULLY, Just booked her for elder abuse.
JAKE," Elder abuse, that's nice. All right, fine. We shouldn't be doing this at a precinct."
BOYLE," I really thought I was gonna get Genevieve out of prison. Then we'd cover ourselves in paint and make love for 25 hours, one more hour than her and Nick."
JAKE," Boyle, you would hate that. Your little hummingbird heart would explode."
BOYLE, I wish I didn't have a heart. I'm off to the cheese shop. And I'm buying by the wheel. [Beat] The cheese wheel.
JAKE," Yeah, I got it."
HOLT," Gina, as you predicted, there was some backlash to the poster campaign."
GINA," Yes, I'm the Nostradamus of your shame."
HOLT," I think a problem the police have had is our inability to admit our mistakes, so this campaign was, um...a mistake. You told me that, but I got defensive and didn't listen. I should have been open to criticism, as this department should be open to criticism. That's why I'm replacing these with...these. My email address is at the bottom, and I intend to respond to every message I receive. Before we put them up, I want to hear your thoughts."
GINA," I love them. Once again, my advice has, like, saved the city."
AMY, I came up with the slogan.
GINA, It's tacky to take credit for stuff.
ROSA," We're here to apologize. I can't prove you took my Moose Tracks, so I shouldn't have yelled at you."
SCULLY, I'm impressed. It takes a big person to admit when they're being a total dum-dum.
TERRY, We want to make it up to you. We got you a pizza.
HITCHCOCK, Only one pizza for both of us? 
ROSA," Oh, my God. That was an obvious setup, you morons."
TERRY, You're eating cheese. You're lying about being lactose intolerant.
SCULLY," No, we weren't. Some things are just delicious enough to suffer the consequences. I'm diabetic, but I still eat sugar out of the bag."
BOTH, Ugh! 
ROSA, Just admit you took my Moose Tracks. Admit it! Admit...It. 
HITCHCOCK," Yeah, we ate it. And we're eating your pizza. So who's the moron now? Ooh, stomach."
SCULLY," Oh, yeah. It's coming."
TERRY," They admitted it. That's a victory, right? "
ROSA," No, Terry. There are no winners here."
SCULLY," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Coming through, coming through! Move it! Move, move, move, move, move, move, move! "
JAKE," Getting in a little late there this morning, Boyle. Where you been? "
BOYLE, Cursing out my own shadow for hanging out with a loser like me. Also an eye doctor appointment.
JAKE," Well, there's something in the holding cell that might cheer you up."
BOYLE, That's Nick's assistant. Why is she here?
JAKE,"  After you left last night, I was thinking about the 24-hour sex painting, ""Genevieve 416."" Check out the date on this receipt from the storage locker with the stolen art."
BOYLE, April 16th. 416!
JAKE," Exactly. She couldn't have rented it, because she was busy getting busy."
BOYLE," Oh, good one. This is fantastic. I mean, I'm not happy that she was having sex with another man, but I'm okay with it if that's what gets her off. "
JAKE," Do you seriously not hear it, because it almost seems intentional at this point."
BOYLE, 'Why would Dvora set Genevieve up? 
JAKE, Because she's in love with Nick. She used one of those latex casts of Genevieve's hand to get the fingerprints so she could break into the gallery.
BOYLE," Wow, I can't believe you kept working the case even after I gave up. That was a nice thing to do."
JAKE," Charles, I didn't do it to be nice. I did it to be amazing. And I think you're a great detective, and I trusted your gut. Go get your girlfriend out of prison."
BOYLE," Oh, thanks, man. Next time you see me, I'm gonna be all out of orgasms."
JAKE," No, you can't say that while you're hugging someone!"
VULTURE," All right, ladies, I don't got a whole lot of time here, so what do you say we make like Boyle's mom and you debrief me? "
BOYLE," Didn't happen, and I should know. She tells me everything."
VULTURE," Yeah, not everything, Chucky. She took off my undies. Hey, Peralta. What is that?"
JAKE, This? 
VULTURE, Yeah.
JAKE," Oh, nothing. Just an open-and-shut case."
VULTURE," Well, it looks like a pretty fat file for a dunker. What is it? "
JAKE, Just some old lady has a missing...torso...that we can't find.
VULTURE, Put it in the Major Crimes pile.
JAKE, But we've already given them all of our felonies.
VULTURE," It's because I got a bet going with the captain of the A4 to see whose squad can solve the most cases. Winner gets to choose a tattoo for the loser, and guess what I'm getting him."
JAKE, Calvin peeing on the Tasmanian Devil? 
VULTURE," No, it's supposed to be a bad tattoo. Man, you're really stupid in the morning, aren't you? "
TERRY," Captain, we all want you to win that bet, but do you think maybe we could keep a few real cases? "
VULTURE," Look, I'm gonna keep it real simple for you. We only solve misdemeanors, wieners. Say it."
ALL, We only solve misdemeanors...Wieners.
VULTURE, Congratulations. You just called yourselves wieners. Dismissed.
GINA, Good morning.
HOLT, For whom?
GINA,"  For you-m. Okay, I can't keep lying. Wuntch is here."
WUNTCH," Oh, there it is. The shriveled husk of Raymond Holt."
HOLT," Look, Gina, is that a talking raisin? "
WUNTCH, Enough foreplay. I'm here to discuss the department's new smuggling task force.
HOLT," The task force? Oh, I thought you'd be handing me another vapid PR assignment."
WUNTCH," I am. We need to choose a phrase to replace the phrase ""task force."" Our research suggests it's too aggressive."
GINA, What? I like it. “Task force” sounds like some sort of body spray for hot dudes.
WUNTCH," Oh, and, um, one more thing. Since your little stunt with the subway poster, I think you could use some supervision. Bob will be keeping an eye on you."
BOB," It's gonna be fun, Ray."
HOLT, But I'm his boss.
WUNTCH," Oh, ouch. How demeaning."
JAKE," Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Sarge, you got to check this out."
TERRY," Jake, what are you doing? We can't work real cases. This is a B and E."
JAKE," Oh, it's so much more than that. Look at these photos. Perp came in through the back window, set up the living room to look like a kid's tea party, didn't steal anything. Do you know what this means? "
TERRY, The victim still has their stuff? 
JAKE," The perp wasn't there to take anything except lives. Sorry, I always wanted to say that. I think this is the work of the Oolong Slayer."
TERRY," Seems like a stretch. If this is the Oolong Slayer, why isn't there a body?"
JAKE," I don't know, maybe he got spooked before the vic got home, or it could be…"
TERRY," Jake, you want a case so bad, you're making one up. Look, the slayer hasn't struck in five years. Chief Garmin set up a task force to find the guy and turned up nothing, and most importantly, the Vulture's orders were ""only misdemeanors, wieners."""
JAKE, Why do you follow people's directions when you could literally pick them up and throw them out the window? Hmm? 
VULTURE," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Was that the sound of a juicy file I heard plopping down on Peralta's desk? Yeah, it was. You just lost your overtime privileges for the month. Everybody, listen up. Anyone caught working on a case that I didn't assign loses their overtime. Capooch? "
ALL, Capooch.
JAKE," Capooch. Uncapooch. You didn't say ""no take backs."" "
VULTURE," Ah, there you are. I got something real special for the two of you. "
AMY," Great, what do you got? "
VULTURE," A month from today is my birthday. I need you to throw me a party, all right? Make it epic, surprise me."
AMY, Are you asking us to plan you a birthday party?
VULTURE," Yeah, Helen Keller. Pay attention."
ROSA, Did you choose us because we're women? 
VULTURE, Women love planning parties. It's in the Bible.
AMY, Unbelievable. What a waste of time.
ROSA, Disagree. This is an amazing use of time. We have complete control over that dummy's birthday party. We can ruin it.
AMY," Yeah, fun. I'll just mess up a captain's orders on purpose. It'll be so...I can't even fake it."
TERRY," Yeah, baby, I can pick up the crib, right after I get the groceries and before I start painting the nursery. Yeah, I can draw a cloud. I don't need a stencil. Okay, I'll get the stencil. Look, I don't know when I'll be home. I'll text you, okay? Ugh, all this paperwork is gonna straight-up kill me. How are you so chipper? "
BOYLE," Oh, simple. I eat a cacao nib every time I close a case."
TERRY, A what? 
BOYLE," A cacao nib. They're these happy little chocolaty delights from deep in the Peruvian rainforest. Here, try one."
TERRY, Do I look like a man who snacks? 
BOYLE," You look like eight circles with suspenders on. But these aren't bad for you. They're full of fiber and antioxidants. Go ahead, try one."
TERRY," Okay, fine. Just one. "
BOYLE, Mm-hmm.
TERRY," Damn, these are good."
BOYLE," And plus, they're organic and fair trade."
TERRY, Terry loves responsible agricultural practices. Mmm.
GINA," Uh-oh. Jake, you should not be here IRL."
JAKE," Gina, my old friend who I grew up with. So good to see you, and I have missed you so much. Is Holt in? "
GINA," Yes, of course he is, but he's in a meeting, and you can not be seen stopping by for chits and/or chats. You need to leave."
JAKE," Gina, I'm not here to waste his time, all right? I have an extremely dope, possibly even disgusting case, and I need to discuss it with him."
GINA," A case? Extra no. If Wuntch finds out he's working on a case, she will punish him. She's on the warpath right now, Jake. The warpath."
JAKE," Okay, copy that. Loud and clear. Don't want to cause a problem. I will skraight-up skedaddle with no further a-do-do."
HOLT, What's going on? 
JAKE," Well, Gina said we couldn't be seen together, and I need your help. Looks like we've both got a pretty bad case of jerk boss."
HOLT," Yes, yours is an idiot, and mine is a fork-tongued lizard witch. The Oolong Slayer. He's back."
JAKE," I knew you would confirm my hunch. He's back to his cool-ass psycho ways. Great news, right? Aside from a serial killer being on the loose."
HOLT, What's your plan? 
JAKE, I'm gonna work the case in secret.
HOLT, Wrong. We're gonna work the case in secret.
JAKE, Holy crap.
HOLT," No one can know about this, understood?"
JAKE, Understood.
GINA, Understood. What? I hang out in the men's room all the time. The acoustics are amazin
HOLT," If I recall correctly, the Oolong Slayer last struck five years ago. He left behind no DNA or fingerprints, but he did leave his calling card, a tea bag in his victim's mouth."
JAKE," Yeah, how cool—I mean, awful is that? "
HOLT," Very cool—I mean, awful. What's our strategy? "
JAKE," One, reexamine all the task force's files, two, check all B &Es against the slayer's MO, and three, think of something supercool to say when we arrest him. My leading contender? ""You're going to jail for oolong time."""
GINA," Jake, that's really good."
JAKE, Right? 
HOLT, Let's not overlook the fact that he turned his crime scenes into tea parties for dollies.
GINA," Which suggests preadolescent trauma leading to a pattern of criminality that probably began as a juvenile. I'm taking an abnormal psych class, and everyone in it is obsessed with me."
HOLT," You look into the B&Es and I'll check out the juvie angle. Now, before we begin in earnest, I'd like to propose a toast. "
JAKE, That's what globes are for.
HOLT, A 25-year-old port seems appropriate.
JAKE, I would have gone 10. I don't know what port is.
HOLT, To catching a serial killer.
JAKE, To catching a serial killer.
GINA," To Rihanna, because I love Rihanna."
TERRY," Okay. Case closed. What time is it? That's right, it's nib o'clock. Whoo, new case, new nib. Read 20 words, that's a nib. Hmm, that nib was kind of small."
BOYLE," Hey, Sarge? You may want to slow down on those things."
TERRY," Things? These are the precious jewels of the rainforest, Boyle."
BOYLE," I don't mean to overstep here, but you're looking a little...fat. Oh, boy."
TERRY, How dare you? You can't comment on my body. This is a workplace. Now I'm feeling objectified by your male gaze. 
BOYLE," Absolutely not. Sir, just listen."
TERRY," No, I don't want to listen, Boyle. You are trying to shame me, and that will not fly."
BOYLE, Okay.
TERRY, Now I need some more nibs just to calm down.
GINA," Jake, dope alley."
JAKE, I know. I think this is where Batman's parents got killed.
HOLT, I'll take your word for it. The juvie angle didn't pan out. 
JAKE," Neither did the B&Es, but I traced the label on the slayer's oolong. Turns out he got it at Chang's Medicinal Tea Shop."
HOLT," Good work, Peralta."
GINA, Breakthrough selfie? 
JAKE, Why not? Breakthrough.
JAKE," So what's the plan, boss? "
HOLT, We create a diversion while Gina copies his customer files.
GINA," My thumb drive looks like a watermelon, because I adore the summertime."
JAKE," Oh, I love that."
HOLT," Let's do this. Oh, hey, pal, that's my ginkgo. "
JAKE," It's my ginkgo now, old man."
HOLT, I'm still young enough to beat that ginkgo out of your hands.
JAKE," This is so much fun. Hit me in the face. Oh, that was a terrible suggestion. Oh. All right. Western medicine rules! "
VULTURE," All right, sluggers. Let's see what you got for the big b-day bash."
AMY, I thought you wanted us to surprise you.
VULTURE," It's a figure of speech, Detective Stupid-ago."
AMY," Well, I was thinking a DJ, two signature cocktails, passed hors d'oeuvres—"
VULTURE," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Passed hors d'oeuvres? What is this, a fundraiser for French dorks? "
AMY, So...no passed hors d'oeuvres? 
VULTURE," I can't even answer that. All right, tough guy. What do you got planned?"
ROSA,  I don't know. Meet at a bar and...drink there.
VULTURE," That's it? Well, it's still better than Santiago's. Look, this is real important to me, all right? My brother's hot wife is gonna be there, and I haven't seen her since his funeral."
AMY, Wow.
VULTURE," Yeah, right? I mean, you only get one shot at your brother's widow."
ROSA, Just go.
JAKE, Partner.
HOLT," Partner. Not many people buy that tea, and only one has been doing so since the killings first began, and he has a record. His name? Braxton O'Reilly."
JAKE," He's a maniac. Arrested in '84 for torturing an animal? Oh, this is our guy. Oh, man, just a squirrel? "
HOLT, Still counts. Let's get that psycho.
JAKE," NYPD, nobody move."
HOLT, Where is Braxton O'Reilly? Where is that psycho monster? 
AGATHA, He's dead.
HOLT, Our condolences.
VULTURE, You were working a case. I freaking knew it. You're a liar.
WUNTCH, And you. You can't do anything except disobey orders and screw up.
BOB, I'm disappointed too.
WUNTCH," No one cares, Bob."
BOB, I’m sorry.
WUNTCH," And after all your so-called detective work, you didn't even get the right guy. Raymond, Raymond, Raymond— "
HOLT," It was an error, but— "
WUNTCH," Do not interrupt me. Raymond, Raymond, Raymond, Raymond. Seven times, once for every day your juicy, insubordinate ass is suspended."
VULTURE," Same goes for you, Peralta. Except for the juicy ass part, because your ass is stupid. "
WUNTCH, Now get the hell out of my office.
JAKE," Wait a minute, sir. You know what? Screw this.  It's ten days now. Shouldn't have gone back in."
JAKE, I am skraight-up depressed. Amy's been doing her best to cheer me up. She gave me this sticker this morning just for waking up.
GINA," Ew, it's like you're dating your teacher."
JAKE," I know. It's so hot. Meanwhile, Holt won't even talk to me. How is he, by the way? "
GINA," Honestly, terrible. I've only heard from him once this week, and that was to tell me he'd finally come up with a new, non-threatening term for task forces. Y'all ready for this? ""Do groups."""
JAKE," Wow, that sucks tremendously. Can I have another port? "
GINA, You're still drinking that stuff? 
JAKE," Yeah, Holt got me hooked on it. I even got a bottle for my house. It's really classing up the booze and take-out menus shelf. Wait a minute. I think I just figured something out. I got to go."
GINA, Aren't you forgetting something?
JAKE, Uh... 
GINA," No, pay your bill. Damn, who raised you? "
ROSA, Oh my God. You friended the Vulture? 
AMY," Well, he's not telling us anything, so it was the only way to figure out what he likes."
ROSA," Maybe this will help. He just said his favorite color is underboob. Look, Amy, you're a good detective. You don't have to perfectly plan some butthead's birthday party."
AMY," I'm sorry, but I believe that hard work pays off."
ROSA, Shut up.
AMY, Excuse me?
ROSA," No, no, no, shut up and look. You're completely right. Your hard work just paid off."
AMY, The Vulture is in a band? Fantastic Jack and the Junkyard Rats.
ROSA," Just when I thought he couldn't be any more the worst, he out the worsts himself."
AMY, I have an idea.
HOLT," I don't know why you insisted on eating here, Gina. It seems like your average greasy spoon."
JAKE, Pardon me. Did one of you order the hot plate of justice?
HOLT," Peralta, what are you doing here? "
JAKE, Saving New York City from a maniacal— 
WOMAN," Um, excuse me? Are those my eggs? "
JAKE," You kind of interrupted an incredible moment, but here, take that."
HOLT," No, no, we can't be seen together. Gina, did you know about this?"
GINA," Uh, tricking you was the only way I could get you to talk to him. Plus, you know I heart intrigue."
JAKE," Sir, take a look at these photos. None of the victims had any alcohol in their apartments. Not even a dusty bottle. You want to know why? Because they were all sober. They all attended 12-step programs, none of them the same one, but they all have the same leader, a creep with a record of torturing animals. I'm talking dogs. I found the Oolong Slayer, and his name is—"
WOMAN," I never do this, but I kind of ordered rye."
JAKE," Ma'am, I'm not a waiter, okay? I'm trying to blow my friend's mind over here."
GINA, Could someone get this lunatic some rye?
JAKE," His name is James Dylan Borden, and he works the night shift at: creep-a-palooza, the mannequin factory in Red Hook. I'll pick you up at 8:00."
HOLT," Are you insane? We were just suspended for screwing up this case. I shouldn't even be talking to you. Wuntch can probably hear us right now. She has super sonar hearing, because she's a bat."
JAKE," Sir, we're tracking a serial killer. There's nothing better. We're living the dream."
HOLT," That's your dream. Mine was to run the Nine-Nine, and that will never happen again. Just give the case to Major Crimes."
JAKE," Wow. Never thought I'd live to see Holt side with the Vulture and Wuntch. Mark the day, Gina. May 18th at 4:00 p.m."
GINA," Oh, honey. We're well into October."
JAKE, Really? 
TERRY," Hey, Charles. I thought you should know. I heard what you said, and it really sank in. I'm off the nibs."
BOYLE, Really? 
TERRY," Of course. I'm Terry Jeffords, and when I put my mind to something, I do it. My resting heart rate is six. Six, Boyle. You know, the rest of you could learn a little something from me. Sure, sometimes we fall down, but it's how we back up that matters. We need to look our failings in the eye and say, ""Not today. Not today, nibs."" "
BOYLE," Oh, Sergeant..."
TERRY, Fine! I'm not better. These nibs are just too damn delicious. 
BOYLE," I don't think the nibs being too yummy is the problem. I think right now, there's too much on your plate—metaphor intended. You're stress eating."
TERRY," That's even worse! The stress isn't going anywhere. I'm about to have my third kid, and they just get more stressful over time, man. Oh, nibs, what am I gonna do? Help me."
JAKE, Huh. Why would a psycho want to work here? Got you. 
BORDEN, Looking for me? 
JAKE," Nope, just taking my gun for a walk through the nightmares factory."
BORDEN," Nice try, cop. But you and I are gonna have a little tea party."
HOLT, Am I invited? Drop the weapon.
JAKE," Okay, slayer. Prepare to go to jail for oolong time."
HOLT," Now say ""punk."" "
JAKE, Punk.
HOLT, Punk! 
JAKE, I said it.
HOLT," Thank you, Peralta."
JAKE, What are you thanking me for? You're the one who showed up and stopped him from shooting me in my beautiful face.
HOLT," No, for giving me one last chance to be a real cop before going back to a lifetime of PR drivel."
JAKE," Sir, we just caught a serial killer. I've wanted this since I was four years old."
HOLT, That's troubling.
JAKE, We did something special here. I'm honored our names will appear next to each other on the arrest report.
HOLT," No, no. I think you should take sole credit. Wuntch will only use it to sink me. I'm glad your dream came true, Peralta. Now, if you'll excuse me, the drivel calls."
VULTURE," Hey, turd monkeys. It's time to celebrate me. Let's rock! Whoo! "
ROSA, His tearaway pants just got stuck. Hiring him to play his own party is straight-up brilliant.
AMY," Yep, because everything he does is a prank on himself."
ROSA," Wow, you're an evil genius. Next time I want to hurt someone, I'm coming straight to you. "
AMY," Aw, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me."
VULTURE," All right, this next song is called ""Mom’s in the Shower."" "
BOYLE," Sarge, I know you have every right to be stressed out: a new kid on the way, Sharon's on bed rest, global warming... "
TERRY, This preamble is making me nibby. Get to the point.
BOYLE," I got the squad to volunteer a little bit of their off time to help you and your family out. I'll make dinner once a week. Everyone else volunteered babysitting time, and Hitchcock offered massage sessions for your wife— "
TERRY, What? 
BOYLE, So I pepper sprayed him.
TERRY," You're a good man, Charles. How can I ever thank you?"
BOYLE," Start taking care of yourself again. I miss those gross, overly large muscles."
TERRY," Lay off my body, dude. I clearly got some stuff to work through."
JAKE," Chief Garmin, thanks for meeting with me. So I have a guy in custody on an attempted B&E."
GARMIN, You scheduled a meeting with the chief of detectives to tell me that? 
JAKE," I did. Oh, I should probably also mention, he's the Oolong Slayer, and this is every bit of evidence you'll need to put him away for good."
GARMIN, Really? 
JAKE, Yeah.
GARMIN,  Wow.
JAKE, Right? 
GARMIN," I spent a decade looking for this monster, and you found him all on your own."
JAKE," Yeah, pretty easily, actually. I imagine that'll look pretty bad for you."
GARMIN, Excuse me? 
JAKE," Unless, of course, I decided to withhold that information, keep it just for myself as a secret. Tell everyone it was you who figured it out."
GARMIN," Why would you do that? What do you want? Your own ""do group""?"
JAKE," No, I actually had something else in mind."
AMY, Captain Holt? This can't be real. Someone please see him before I punch myself in the face.
HOLT," Hello, squad."
TERRY, Oh my God. Captain? 
HOLT," Good news. The Vulture is out, and I'm back."
TERRY," Glad you're back, Captain."
BOYLE, We really missed you.
TERRY, How'd you get them to reinstate you?
HOLT,  I didn't. I guess someone just had my back.
BOYLE," Wait, where's Gina? "
HOLT, She wanted to make a proper entrance.
GINA, Or was I never really gone?
HOLT," Good morning, Boyle. It's Halloween; I'm surprised you didn't put on a costume."
BOYLE," I was going to, sir, but then I decided screw that jazz. Well, I'm the only one who ever dresses up, no one ever gets my costume, and they make fun of me, so I'm done. These people don't deserve my dress-up gifts."
JAKE," Charles, seriously? No costume? "
TERRY," What the hell, Charles? Where's your Halloween spirit? "
BOYLE, But you guys always make fun of me.
GINA," I have never once insulted you in my life, especially vis-á-vis your appearance."
ROSA," Yeah, man, we always love your costumes."
JAKE," Remember last year, when you came as that...person and/or thing? "
BOYLE," Yes, I do remember! Sir, permission to sprint to my car and get my emergency costume?"
HOLT, Does it matter if I say no? 
BOYLE, No! 
BOYLE," A-bam, bam, boom. What—the what—"
ROSA, Why are you dressed up? You look like an idiot.
BOYLE, But—but— 
AMY," Yeah, what are you supposed to be, a sassy car mechanic? "
JAKE," No, come on, he's clearly the rejected Pop-Tarts mascot, Harry Pop-Tart."
BOYLE, I am not! You know who I am!
HOLT," Squad, that's enough. You're making Boyle feel bad on purpose. He's Elvis."
BOYLE, Yes!
HOLT," Elvis Stojko, the Canadian figure skater."
BOYLE, No! 
JAKE," Attention, squad: today is the most important day in the history of this precinct. For today is Halloween—I thought we were going to say it together."
HOLT, I never agreed to that.
JAKE," All right. As you may know, for the past two years, Captain Holt and I have engaged in an epic battle of wits. The goal: to determine who must call the other an amazing detective/genius."
HOLT," The first year, by sheer, dumb luck, Jake eked out a feeble victory."
JAKE," And last year, I let the captain win, because he's old and sad."
HOLT, Sad because the competition was so dismal.
TERRY, Is this meeting about something?
JAKE, It's about everything.
HOLT," This year's the tie-breaker, a final heist to decide once and for all the true king of the Nine-Nine."
JAKE, Halloween Heist III: The Heistening. Tagline? 
HOLT," This year, we both attempt to steal the same object, instead of Jake attempting to steal one from me."
JAKE," I gave you one direction on the tagline—snappy. But yes, we will be attempting to steal the same item: this."
HOLT," ;The crown will be locked in this briefcase, which in turn will be locked in the interrogation room."
JAKE," And so unto the briefcase goes the crown...Didn't sing it with me. We will need help, so to be fair, we're holding a draft. The captain and I have given up our overtime, so everyone who participates will get the night off. Captain? "
HOLT," With the first pick of the draft, I choose Terry."
AMY," Okay, brawns over brains."
JAKE," All right, I take Charles."
AMY, I get it. Close friend.
HOLT, I pick Gina.
AMY, Gina? 
JAKE, I take Rosa.
AMY," What? Okay, all right. Well, Captain that leaves me with you.  Let's do this."
HOLT," Hang on, Santiago. I'm not sure I can trust you. You're Peralta's... paramour. Maybe you should be on his team."
JAKE," No, no, no. Amy would do anything to win your approval, including pretending to be in a relationship with me for the past few weeks, only to betray me now."
AMY," Jake, you are majorly overthinking this."
JAKE," Maybe, but it's a risk I'm not willing to take.  You're not on my team, Amy."
HOLT," Yeah, Amy's out. By midnight, whoever has the crown will be the king of the Nine-Nine."
SCULLY," Uh, Hitchcock and I still haven't been chosen."
 HOLT, I'm good.
JAKE, Me too.
BOYLE," So, I see you've been assigned to guard the briefcase too."
GINA," Yup. I'm not supposed to let it or you out of my sight, if that even is you."
BOYLE," Ow, that's my face! "
GINA," Oh, sorry, I thought it was a cheap, rubber mask."
BOYLE," Well, I have exciting news. I found the perfect guy to set you up with."
GINA," After zero consideration, I'm happy to say, ""hard pass."" "
BOYLE, Come on. Our parents are married. Genevieve and I are dating. I want you to have someone too. You shouldn't have to slow dance alone after family dinner.
GINA," How did my life come to this? Charles, it's very sweet that you want to set me up with someone, but I do not trust your taste in guys at all."
BOYLE, I have spectacular taste in men. You would love Nadia.
GINA, His name is Nadia?
BOYLE," Oh, all of a sudden Nadia's not a cool name? You are impossible."
JAKE," Here, got it?"
ROSA, Got it.
AMY," Hey, Jake. Can we talk?"
JAKE, Yeah.
AMY, You really hurt my feelings by leaving me off your team.
JAKE," Oh, I had no idea you felt that way."
AMY," Well, it doesn't feel great to be left out."
JAKE," Right, totally, I get it. I'm sorry...Captain Holt! "
AMY, What? Why are you yelling at my boobs? 
JAKE," Because that's where the camera is. Nice try, Ray-Ray!"
AMY," There's no camera, Jake. I was being serious."
JAKE," Okay fine—if you're telling the truth, then I sincerely apologize. But since you're not, I will defeat you! Haha! Ahhh! Gah! Scary witch! Scary, so scary! "
HITCHCOCK," Amy, don't feel bad. You can get in on my bet with Scully. At midnight tonight, we will steal his foot fungus cream."
AMY," Thanks, that's very kind of you to include me, but I'll have to pass."
SCULLY, The mind games have already begun.
AMY," No, I'm not part of this."
HITCHCOCK," Oh, of course not. Neither am I. Wink."
AMY, Ugh.
GINA, I'm not going to meet my next boyfriend through a Charles set-up. I'm going to meet him in an illegal dance competition in an abandoned subway tunnel.
ROSA," It's go time, Boyle. Holt and Terry have closed the blinds. Release the roaches."
GINA," Alternately, he could win an illegal street race in which my love is the prize."
BOYLE," Oh my God! Gina, look! Roaches! "
GINA," Ew, Charles, kill them with whatever cologne you're wearing! "
BOYLE," No, I can't! They're moving too fast! I can't kill them! It's pandemonium! "
GINA," If I die, turn my Tweets into a book! "
JAKE," Commence operation, ""Oh crap, wrong vent."" Oh crap, wrong vent. This was a mistake."
GINA," Nice try, losers. You blew it."
JAKE," Yeah, we totally blew it. And all because Boyle marked the wrong vent."
BOYLE, It's not my fault. I thought it was the right vent.
JAKE," Unbelievable, mister."
BOYLE," You are, mister."
JAKE, I'm having trouble even believing you at all right now. That is the last time I let Charles mark a vent.
BOYLE, I'm normally great at marking vents.
ROSA, Lock picked.
JAKE," Never, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever, will I ever, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, never, never, never—I forgive you, and good-bye. "
ROSA," I somersaulted through a window, cut the crown out of a briefcase, and replaced everything in under a minute."
JAKE," Yeah, I guess you helped a little. But...our fake argument was super convincing. And all of a sudden, we had to make it longer, and we did. Anyways, now all we gotta do is guard this drawer until midnight, and the best part about it is—Captain Holt has absolutely no idea. He is such a fool."
HOLT," Yes, I'm the fool. You fool."
TERRY, So we wanted Jake to take the crown? 
HOLT," Sergeant, are you familiar with the Hungarian fencing term, Hosszú Gorcs? "
TERRY, You must realize my answer is no.
HOLT," It's a strategy of letting your opponent win points early to give them a sense of overconfidence, thus exposing a much easier target for you later."
TERRY, You think he's overconfident enough? 
AMY," Sir, do you have a minute? "
HOLT," Of course. Jeffords, we'll rendezvous later."
AMY," Sir, I want to talk about Jake.  Okay— "
HITCHCOCK, Amy! Help! Our foot fungus heist has gone sideways! 
AMY," Hitchcock, not now."
HITCHCOCK," Scully doesn't know I'm in here. I stole his foot cream, but then I lost it. Amy, you're the only hope I have of finding it. You're a detective."
AMY," You're a detective! Get out of here! Go! Sir, Jake really pissed me off, and I want to help you take him down."
HOLT," Well, that's an intriguing proposition. You certainly could be useful—"
AMY, Thank you.
HOLT," To Jake! I got you, Peralta! You're not fooling anyone! "
AMY, Why does everyone think that's where a camera would be? 
HOLT," Because the cleavage cloaks the camera with its curves. That will be all, spy. Sorry I said cleavage."
AMY,  Mm-hmm.
GINA," Charles, that is so nasty you put cockroaches in your pants."
BOYLE," When you say it like that, yeah. But Jake made it sound so cool."
GINA, How? 
BOYLE," Oh, I wasn't expecting anyone. Come in, Nadia."
NADIA," Hey, Charles."
BOYLE," What up, bro? Gina, this was the boy I was telling you about."
GINA, You're Nadia? 
NADIA," Well, my real name's Leo. Nadia's just my tag. I don't love it, but when Banksy gives you a nickname, it just sticks."
GINA," Okay, I see what's going on here. This isn't a setup—this is a setup. And all of this is supposed to distract me from the heist."
NADIA, The heist? 
GINA," “The heist?” You shut your hot lips. Charles, I don't buy it. This is an obvious trap, okay? Who are you, really, hmm? You some male prostitute that Charles busted out on some lonely pier somewhere? Well, guess what, sweetie? This is one trick you ain't gonna be turning tonight."
NADIA, I'm not a prostitute.
GINA," Okay. Right. Bye-bye, whore."
HOLT," It's go time, Sergeant."
TERRY," Hey, Rosa. I'm not saying these are from your motorcycle, but I found these stripped handlebars outside."
ROSA, You better not have messed with my bike for this heist. Let me remind you I'm carrying a weapon.
TERRY," We all have the same weapons. Damn, Rosa! Where'd you get that? The scorpion has left the nest."
HOLT, And...Ding.
SHARON, ...​​​​​See Daddy? Come on.
HOLT, Time for the twin twist.
SHARON," Hey, Jake."
JAKE," Hey, you guys."
SHARON, We wanted to surprise Terry. Have you seen him?
JAKE," Oh, he just went downstairs for a bit, but he should be back soon."
SHARON, Oh. Cagney? Lacey? Do you guys want to take a picture with Uncle Jake? 
BOTH, Yeah! 
SHARON," You don't mind, do you? "
JAKE," Um, no, of course not. That would be so fun."
SHARON," What if we do it in the briefing room, like you're assigning them a case? "
JAKE," No! I mean, you know what would be fun even more that that is if we took a picture right here, and I could have my hand on this cabinet."
SHARON, Okay...
JAKE, Nailed it.
SHARON," Here we go. Oh, God, it was in video mode sorry."
JAKE," Take your time. I could do this all day. Matter of fact, what if we did one where I had both hands on the cabinet—one on top, and then one on the front? "
SHARON," Looks good, yeah. All right, smile. Three, two, one—Cheese! Very good. Great, you guys. Let's go find Daddy."
JAKE, What's going on? Aha! What are you doing? 
HOLT," Nothing—just enjoying a taste of my favorite beverage, the soda pop."
JAKE, Really? I have never seen you enjoy soda pop before.
HOLT, Hmm.
JAKE, Have some now.
HOLT, Ahh. It's delicious.
JAKE," I don't buy it. You're making the same face you made when you found a chocolate chip in your trail mix. Something's up. I'm patting you down. Damn it, nothing but a surprisingly toned set of abs."
HOLT," Why would I have the crown, Jake? Isn't it still in the interrogation room? "
JAKE," Yes. Yes. Of course. Of course it's still in there. Welp, I guess I'll see you at midnight. After you."
HOLT," No, after you."
JAKE, I insist.
TERRY, You drank a soda? Not sure that's the worst thing in the world.
HOLT," It was the worst thing in the world—worse than a fruit-forward Riesling. No, I'm not exaggerating. Anyhow, I cleverly ditched the crown in a trash can. Wait a minute so as to not arouse suspicion and then retrieve it."
TERRY," Got it. Hey, while I'm in there, should I get you a soda?"
HOLT," I know you're joking, but on the off chance you aren't—No."
TERRY," Hi, there."
JAKE," Oh, is it? "
ROSA, The handlebar thing was fake. They were trying to distract me. I think they made a play for the crown.
JAKE," I know, but I had my hand on the cabinet the whole time, so I'm pretty confident there's no way they could have gotten it. They got it."
ROSA, Look at the back. Screws are loose.
JAKE, Damn it. That son of a bitch is good.
TERRY," Sir, we got a problem. The crown wasn't in the trash can. Jake must have taken it back."
HOLT, Damn it. That son of a bitch is good.
JAKE," We have to get that crown back. I already changed my email to ""kingjakerulez"" with a ""Z."" Everyone's going to think I'm an idiot."
HOLT," Hello, Peralta."
JAKE, Captain.
HOLT, Midnight nears.
JAKE," Yes, it does. Tick tock."
HOLT, Tick tock indeed.
JAKE, But tick tock for who? 
HOLT," You know it's ""for whom."" Don't try to provoke me. "
JAKE, I didn't know that.
BOTH, I'm going to get that crown back.
HOLT, Wait—what? 
JAKE, Huh? Will you excuse me for just one moment? 
HOLT," Yes, I too need to be excused."
JAKE, He doesn't have the crown! 
ROSA, What? Who has it then?
HOLT, I don't know who has it.
TERRY, What do we do? 
JAKE," Pull the security tape. I'll distract them. Hey, look at this. Ahhhhhhhhhh. Damn it, how did that not work? "
GINA," Hmm, Captain Holt said you guys stole the crown when Jake came through the ceiling."
BOYLE," Yeah, I can't believe you fell for that. You really think I'd mark the wrong vent? I've never marked a wrong vent in my life."
GINA, You're very intense about vents.
BOYLE, Yeah.
GINA," Wait, so Nadia wasn't just a distraction? "
BOYLE," No, 100% real. Handsome, cool, hair as thick as a collie's. I found you the perfect guy, and you drove him off."
GINA, Ugh. I'm sorry. I should have trusted you. Please call him and tell him I messed up.
BOYLE," Fine, but only if you agree that your first date will be a double date with me and Genevieve on a week-long trip to Turks and Ca— "
GINA," Forget it, no. Forget it."
BOYLE," No! Okay, I'll call him. Please, I want this so badly."
GINA," Fine, you may call him for me."
BOYLE, Thank you.
JAKE," Okay, here I am taking pictures with Terry's kids. Man, I look so strong standing next to them. Should I have kids? "
ROSA, Sure.
JAKE, Okay.
ROSA," It's Holt. Whoa, how did he do that?"
JAKE," Guy has an insane set of abs. Oh, look, he's got the crown. And he's headed to the break room."
ROSA, He dumped it in the trash. Did he go back and get it? 
JAKE," Nope, janitor came in and took it. But which janitor? Looks like I'm going to have to squint. His name is Al. Al the janitor. All right, it's 11:00 P.M. now; that means Al's long gone. How are we going to get his home address? "
ROSA, Who's the one person you know who's anal enough to send out holiday cards to every single employee? 
JAKE, Amy! 
AMY," What do you want, Jake? "
JAKE," What? Why would you assume that I want anything? What I want is to apologize to my girlfriend, who I hurt."
AMY," It's ""whom."" "
JAKE," Why does the word ""who"" even exist if you're not allowed to say it? Anyways, now that I've apologized and you've accepted, can you give me janitor Al's address? "
AMY," This is related to your heist, isn't it? "
JAKE," No, no. It's about a crime. I think janitor Al is going to kill the president."
HOLT," Oh, Santiago. There's my protégé."
AMY, Let me guess—you want the janitor's address.
HOLT, Janitor? Address? Al? 
AMY," I never said his name. Well, isn't this rich. After being excluded by both of you, here I am with the power to decide who wins and who loses your little heist."
HOLT, I wouldn't have it any other way. You are my wisest detective.
JAKE," Pathetic. She can't be manipulated, sir. Amy, we are in love. I know we've never said it before, but I think this is the perfect time, don't you? "
HOLT, Love? Ha. What's love compared to the respect of a workplace superior? 
JAKE," Amy Santiago, will you m— "
AMY," Enough! Okay. Pretending to be nice to me is worse than being mean. You know what? You want the address? Here, you can both have it. Hope you're happy, you selfish monsters."
JAKE, I feel terrible.
HOLT, We should apologize.
JAKE," Yes, I agree. You definitely should now; I'll do mine later."
HOLT, Fat chance.
JAKE," Charles, I need your butt. Meet me downstairs."
HOLT," Alpha Team, this is the Golden Sparrow. Rendezvous at Drop Zone Yankee."
JAKE, When did you come up with those code names? 
JAKE," Okay, he lives on the sixteenth floor."
ROSA, I think we beat Holt here.
HOLT, Or did you? 
BOYLE, I'll get the elevator.
JAKE," Crap! Looks like we're taking the stairs. All right, it's sixteen floors--pace yourselves. Forget it. Run as fast as you can! Ha ha! I win. I knocked first. You're not Al."
WOMAN, You're looking for Al? 
HOLT," Of course we're looking for Al, you imbecile! Sorry."
WOMAN, He's having a cigarette on the roof.
JAKE, The roof?
JAKE, Yes. I did it. I am the greatest athlete in the world.
HOLT, Al? Al? Where's Al? 
JAKE," Oh, there he is. There he is! I did it. I did it."
HOLT, Good God. Are you Al the janitor? 
AMY, Nope. I'm your worst nightmare...Amy Santiago.
JAKE," Oh, no."
HOLT, I don't understand what is happening.
JAKE, Allow me to explain. Amy and I were ahead of you the whole time.
AMY," No, you weren't part of this. Get back over to the loser side, loser."
JAKE, All right. Worth a shot.
ROSA, So how'd you pull it off?
AMY," Well, it all started when I went to tell Jake how badly he hurt my feelings, and he yelled at my breasts."
JAKE," Oh, boy, I am not going to come off well in this story."
AMY," Nope. Remember when you set off the witch? You made Captain Holt flinch, which was weird, since his door as closed, but not weird, since he actually heard it over a bug he planted at your desk. It was in an old muffin that you never threw in the trash."
JAKE, That's why people throw away garbage.
AMY, How are we together? 
JAKE, Eh.
AMY," Anyway, I tapped into the bug's frequencies, so I had ears on Jake. I needed to know what Holt was up to. That's where Hitchcock came in."
HITCHCOCK, I masterminded the entire plan.
AMY," You did one small thing, and I had to explain it to you, like, 45 times. He left a tiny crack in the blinds, so I could read the Captain's lips. ""Sharon and your kids will distract Jake. They'll be here at 9:30 sharp. My waffle xylophone on the cheese man.” "
HOLT, What? 
AMY," My lip-reading is not flawless. Now that I knew your plan, it was simple to disrupt. While Scully gracefully moved the witch, I got into character. Holt triggered the witch, which brought Jake into the room."
HOLT, And I threw the crown in the trash can.
AMY," Exactly as I planned. Then I sent you all here, placed an out-of-order sign on the perfectly functional elevator, made you all walk up and vomit twice. "
JAKE," Actually, it was four times, if you count all the stairwell stuff."
AMY," You thought I was just Holt's lackey. And you thought I was just Jake's girlfriend. Well, I'm my own person, capable of making my own decisions, and I decided to humiliate you both."
JAKE," Well, you did, and it was awesome. One last question: where's the crown?"
AMY," Oh, it's at Shaw's Bar, the official site of my coronation."
JAKE," All hail the crown of destiny. And all hail she who wears it, Amy Santiago, the…"
AMY, Queen.
JAKE, Queen of the Nine-Nine.
AMY, I believe there's something else you both need to say.
HOLT, Gladly.
JAKE AND HOLT, Amy Santiago is an amazing detective/genius.
HOLT, Drinks are on us.
JAKE, Nope.
HOLT, Drinks are on me.
ALL, Yeah! 
GINA, Hey. I'm glad you showed up. Sorry I was acting so weird earlier.
NADIA," Hey, I don't blame you. Sagittarius, right? With Saturn where it is, you're right to be wary of new relationships."
GINA, How is it possible that a spirit such as yourself even knows Charles?
NADIA, I did an art show at Genevieve's gallery.
GINA," Oh, right, so you're not really friends, you know his girlfriend through the art world."
NADIA," Yeah. Plus, she's my twin sister."
GINA, What? 
GENEVIEVE," Hi, Leo. A kiss for my bro. And a kiss for my boo."
GINA, No.
BOYLE, A kiss for my boo. And a kiss for my sis.
GINA, No!
GREG," Oh, Vince. And he's not a doctor. He's a pharmacist. Although that might appeal to Anne. Paw-paw-paw."
GREG," Oh, now, Stella, you know I'm still getting over the tragic loss of my wife. She was such a strong, female woman with nice, heavy breasts."
GREG," Oh, that's my neighbor. Hey, Larry."
LARRY," Oh, hey... Greb."
GREG, Greg.
LARRY," Ah, that was it. I'm not sure why I have so much trouble remembering, probably 'cause our relationship is so casual."
LARRY," Morning, ladies."
STELLA, Hi.
GREG," Uh, do a lap without me. I need to talk to Larry about an issue with our shared fence."
GREG," Larry, I need to talk to you about an issue with our shared fence."
LARRY," Yes, I also need to discuss this shared fence issue with you."
GREG," Okay, they're out of earshot. Why are you up so early?"
LARRY, No reason just excited to face a new day.
GREG," Oh, because ever since we've been down here, you've been a little depressed."
LARRY, Have I?
GREG," No, no, no, don't eat the burrito."
LARRY," Oh, I'm disgusting."
LARRY," Okay, fine, I may have had a teensy bit of trouble adjusting when we first got here for, like, six teensy, little months, but I took your advice, and I got a job."
GREG, Doing what?
LARRY," I sell ATVs now, eh?"
LARRY," Well, the truth is, these little babies sell themselves. They're super fun, and they're a lot safer than you might think if you're standing next to one. If you're driving it, it's actually much more dangerous than you could possibly imagine."
GREG," Well, a job is good. I know being stuck down here in Florida isn't ideal, but we need to make the best of it. In fact, I'm applying for a promotion at my new job."
LARRY," Ah, very ""noice""."
GREG," And if all goes well, tonight you might be neighbors with Greg Stickney, Assistant Manager."
LARRY," Very double ""noice"". Well, I'm off to work."
LARRY, Might want to stand back. You're kind of in the blast zone here. Don't want to forget the strap.
LARRY, Safety first. That's what I always-
LARRY," Ooh, okay! Whoa!"
GREG," You deserve this promotion. Now go in there and get it. Give 'em hell, Greg."
GREG," Good morning, Carly, Tanny. Looks like you're keeping the machines running smoothly."
CARLY, Whatever.
GREG, Carly will be the first to go.
GREG," Excuse me, sir, there's something I'd like to talk to you about."
MANAGER," Uh, one second. I'm busy."
MANAGER," Oh, at the buzzer! Suck it, Chase, you dirty, little hippy."
GREG," Uh, yes, well, um, as you know, I've been here for four months, and I think I'm a model employee."
MANAGER," Oh, no doubt. No doubt. You had the idea to install sinks in the bathrooms. I love that."
GREG," Yes, what I'm getting at is, I'd like to be assistant manager."
MANAGER, You serious?
MANAGER," Oh, I just never expected you to be interested in management. I mean, you don't seem like the type of person who's really interested in leadership roles."
GREG, Really? Anyone who knows me would say the opposite. I'm very hard-working.
MANAGER," Yeah, when you're not totally blazed."
GREG, I assure you that's not me.
MANAGER," Okay, tell that to the Count Blunt-ula T-shirt that you were rocking last week."
GREG, It was the only thing in lost and found. A child and his father threw up on me.
MANAGER," Okay, I'll think about it."
MANAGER," Management! Full of surprises, Greg."
GREG, Hello?
MYSTERY WOMAN, Go to location one now.
GREG, Marshal Haas.
MARSHAL, Larry.
LARRY, I can't hear you. Can you hear me?
MARSHAL, I cannot hear you.
GREG, What did you say? We can't hear you.
LARRY, I can't hear you; I think my engine's too loud.
MARSHAL, It's your engine. Turn off your engine.
LARRY, I don't know how to turn off the engine. We should talk in your car.
MARSHAL, Let's all talk in my car.
GREG, Let's talk in the marshal's car.
LARRY, I think we should talk in her.
MARSHAL, Okay. Let's go over the normal checklist stuff. Have you had any contact with anyone from your previous life?
GREG AND LARRY, No.
MARSHAL, Has anyone questioned your current identity either in person or online?
GREG AND LARRY, No.
MARSHAL," Pop quiz. Greg, where did you go to college?"
GREG," Ohio State, where I majored in... communications."
MARSHAL," Perfect. Larry, what's your favorite movie?"
LARRY," Uh, ""Die Hard""."
MARSHAL," Wrong. Jake's favorite movie is ""Die Hard"", I asked you for Larry's favorite movie."
LARRY, Two people can have the same favorite movie.
MARSHAL," They can, but they don't. Larry's favorite movie is ""Failure to Launch"". Say it. Say, ""My favorite movie is 'Failure to Launch'""."
LARRY," My favorite movie is ""Failure to Launch""."
MARSHAL," I wish I could believe you. Moving on, three weeks ago an informant told the FBI where to find Jimmy ""The Butcher"" Figgis."
MARSHAL," Acting on that lead, 50 federal agents and I raided a warehouse in Paramus. It was awesome."
LARRY, So you got him- it's over- We can go home?
MARSHAL," No, sorry. Figgis wasn't there. The raid was awesome. Caught up with a lot of dudes I don't normally get to see."
LARRY, Do you know what happened to Figgis?
MARSHAL," No, but what we do know is that Figgis was never there. Our Intel was wrong from minute one."
GREG, Is there any way we could help with the investigation?
MARSHAL," No, absolutely not. Your involvement would endanger your lives and this case."
MARSHAL," I'm sorry, but it looks like Larry and Greg will be in Florida indefinitely."
MARSHAL," Pop quiz, Larry: who's the female lead in ""Failure to Launch""?"
LARRY, Kate Hudson?
MARSHAL," Sarah Jessica Parker, man! God, it's like you want to die."
GREG, So we're in Florida indefinitely. You okay?
LARRY," I squirt-anly am. Poor choice of words, but the sentiment remains."
LARRY, What? You were right. It's the job. It keeps me focused.
GREG," Well, good, I'm glad to hear it."
LARRY," Yep. Now if you'll excuse me, I got to drive this Bee-otch back to work."
GREG, What?
LARRY," Oh, sorry. This is the Ikura Bee-otch 5,000. Brand-new model. Just came in."
LARRY," I was gonna go for the 10,000, but that Bee-otch is way too fancy."
LARRY, See you soon.
LARRY," Hey, babe."
LARRY," Okay, Jimmy Figgis. Where the hell are you?"
GREG," Oh, Larry."
GREG, So I marched in there and I told him I wanted that assistant manager position.
STELLA, I wish my son had your backbone. Then he could finally divorce Emily. What does he see in her anyway?
GREG," Probably her breasts, which are heavier than average. I don't mean to be crude, ladies, but that's just how the straight mind works."
GREG," Oh, hey, Larry."
LARRY," Ah, hello, Groot."
GREG, Greg.
LARRY, Right.
GREG, Is there an issue with our shared fence that we must discuss?
LARRY," Nope, our shared fence is fine. Just off to work."
GREG, Is there something going on at the ATV lot?
LARRY," Yes, uh, having a sale on big, old springs."
GREG, Shocks.
LARRY," Right. I knew that; I was just dumbing it down for you. At any rate, I am off. Honk, honk."
LARRY, I don't know where the horn is.
LARRY, Gahh! What the-
GREG, ATVs? The only thing you're selling is a huge pile of bunk.
LARRY, How did you get here so fast? You were walking.
GREG, I was power-walking.
GREG," Roll heel, ball, toe roll heel, ball, toe."
GREG," I was already suspicious about your new positive attitude towards Florida, a state you once described as ""America's stinky butt""."
GREG," But then, after we met the marshal, you said something very strange."
LARRY," It was ""squirt-anly,"" wasn't it?"
GREG," No, something much stranger."
LARRY, You were right.
GREG," I knew then that you were up to something, so I followed you here. I guessed the combination on the first try: 69-69."
LARRY," June 9, 1969, the day my parents got married."
GREG," No, it isn't."
LARRY, My mom's birthday.
GREG, No.
LARRY, The moon landing.
GREG, Nope.
LARRY," Fine, you're right. It's a completely random number. Look, the feds are useless. They're never gonna catch Figgis, so I'm working the case. I want to get home and see Amy. Don't you want to see Kevin?"
GREG, Of course I do. But we were told not to get involved. Why can't you just follow orders?
LARRY," Because I hate this stupid place, and I've got to get out. This town's claim to fame is that its mayors keep dying, and no one knows why. That's insane."
GREG," You're selfish, and you're putting my life at risk. So no, you're not getting those files back. I suggest you accept the reality of the situation and make the best of it. Snap out of it, and get a job."
LARRY, Okay. Interesting idea. I wonder who's hiring.
MANAGER," Hey, everyone, just want to introduce you to our new assistant manager."
MANAGER, Larry Sherbet.
GREG, Son of a bitch.
MANAGER," Larry, you want to say a few words?"
LARRY," Absolutely. Thanks. Hey, everybody. Uh, couple things about my management style. Number one: don't nobody ask me about what's in my cup, we ain't gonna have no problems."
LARRY," Uh, two, I believe in the power of nicknames. Smile Face"
LARRY, Señorita Swag
LARRY, Kahuna!
MANAGER," Oh, yeah."
LARRY," And you, my friend, we will call Mr. Fart."
GREG, Seems rather unprofessional.
MANAGER," He called you ""Mr."" Fart, Mr. Fart."
LARRY," Thanks, Kahuna. Guys, can I get real with you for one sec?"
LARRY," I used to work for a real stickler the type of guy that just got off on telling me what to do. One time, he invaded my private space and stole my stuff."
MANAGER, Why would he do that?
GREG, Perhaps he had a good reason.
LARRY," Wrong, Mr. Fart. He was a jerk and he sucked. But he was the one who motivated me to get off my ass and get this job, so in a way, we really have him to thank for all this happening."
MANAGER, Give it up.
MANAGER," How great is this guy, Greg?"
LARRY," Wait, that's Greg?"
MANAGER, Yeah.
LARRY, The stoner?
MANAGER," Yeah, look at him. He's such a Rasta."
LARRY," Aw, total Rasta."
GREG, How did you even get this job? You have zero experience. I guess you lied on your resume.
LARRY," Greg, you stoney macaroni."
LARRY, Of course I lied on my resume. Our entire lives are a lie. I straight up said I was that guy who landed the plane on the Hudson.
GREG," Taking my job just to spite me that's low, even for you."
LARRY," Oh, but it's not spite. It's blackmail. I'm gonna be your boss, and I'm gonna make your life miserable, unless you give me back my Figgis file."
GREG," Oh, never gonna happen."
LARRY, Okay. Suit yourself. Hope you like kids' birthdays.
LARRY," Hey, everyone, someone just volunteered to be DJ B-Day."
GREG," Here at the Fun Zone, we live by one rule: when it's your birthday, you're always cool. Parents and kids are all the same. Watch as I do a dance to your name."
GREG, D-d-d-d-d-d-Derek. D-d-d-d-d-d-Derek.
LARRY, Again.
LARRY, Figure out what's living in there yet?
GREG," Well, uh, judging by the empty beer cars, the fur, the pornography, and the claw marks, I'd say a homeless man and a raccoon. The exact nature of their relationship is still revealing itself."
LARRY, I'm gonna assume sexual. You ready to give me those files yet?
GREG, No.
LARRY," Well, then, I guess it's time for your next task. You're gonna need to change."
GREG, Into what?
LARRY," Oh, Mr. Fart. You look perfect."
GREG, So a silly costume is that all you got?
LARRY," Hardly. Every time a go-kart drives by, I want you to scream, and this is very important."
LARRY," ""Me so corny!"""
GREG," You can ruin my job, Larry, but that's not all I've got here in Florida. I've got a life. I've got friends."
LARRY, You sure about that?
LARRY," Honestly, Estelle, it almost sounds like you should stop eating beef altogether."
STELLA, I know. That's what I keep saying.
GREG," Oh, go to hell, Larry! That's my walking group!"
LARRY, Off to get my file?
GREG," No, you will never get the f-"
LARRY, Greg!
LARRY, Are you okay?
GREG," Yes, but we got bigger problems."
FLORIDA WOMAN, This is gonna break the Internet.
LARRY," No, no, ma'am, please, you can not put that on the Inter- oh!"
FLORIDA WOMAN, I was hoping that would happen. Yes! Yes!
GREG, I don't think your wrist is supposed to move like that.
LARRY," No, it's been like this since I broke it playing football in high school."
LARRY," Fine, I petted a horse too hard."
GREG," If that woman posts her camera phone video that she took with a camera phone camera to the Internet, Figgis could figure out where we are. This is your fault."
LARRY," Or maybe it's your fault for stealing my files. You know what? It doesn't matter. We have to get that video. Can we please just press ""pause"" on this fight and work together?"
GREG," Yes, on one condition: you stay the hell away from my walking group."
LARRY, The walking group meant nothing to me.
GREG, That's even worse.
LARRY," Okay, fine, I'll stop. What did this lady look like?"
GREG," White, female, 5'3"", T-shirt that read, ""Orgasm Donor""."
LARRY, We need more.
LARRY, We need access to the security tapes.
LARRY," Okay, we got teenagers stealing a stuffed gorilla, old lady siphoning gas out of a go-kart, junkie ripping copper wires out of the wall God, this place is messed up."
LARRY, Ah! There you are.
GREG, What did you find?
LARRY, Not much. Camera was behind her. But look at her calf.
LARRY, It's a tattoo of Jesus punching bin Laden in the nuts.
GREG, Hmm. Maybe a local tattoo artist will recognize it. It can't be that common.
TATTOO ARTIST, That's the most common tattoo we give.
GREG, So these photos tell us nothing?
TATTOO ARTIST," Actually, you know what? That's a high school graduation ring. Dan Marino High, class of 2003."
LARRY," Marino High, home of the Dolphins, I suspect."
TATTOO ARTIST," Nope, Pet Detectives. Town was really into Marino's cameo in ""Ace Ventura""."
LARRY," Ah, it stands to reason. Classic film, one of my childhood favorites. And it only gets overtly transphobic at the very end, so a win."
LARRY," Anyway, thank you very much. You've been very helpful."
TATTOO ARTIST," But you guys getting ink, or what?"
GREG," No, I already have a tattoo."
LARRY, What? Where? Why? How? When?
GREG, I will never talk about it again.
LARRY," Okay, now all we have to do is go to Dan Marino High and get all the personal info on the class of 2003 and then show each other our tattoos. You go first."
GREG," Oh, never gonna happen. We're not cops anymore. How are we gonna get access to those files?"
LARRY," Easy: I walk in there dressed as an exterminator saying I'm from 1-2-3 Pest Removal. Secretary's like, ""Never heard of you"". Then I'm like:"
LARRY," ""Listen, lassie, it's best you let me speak with your principal""."
LARRY," I hear it. I'm gonna drop the accent. She takes me to see the principal, you walk in behind me and download the file."
GREG," The only question is, where are we gonna find an exterminator's outfit?"
LARRY, We're gonna need khaki pants and a khaki shirt.
GREG, To my casual wear closet.
LARRY," Hey, there, I'm the exterminator here for the-"
RECEPTIONIST," Yes, you're here for the snakes."
LARRY," Oh, right. The snakes, yes. That is why I'm here."
RECEPTIONIST, This way.
LARRY, Okay.
GREG," I found our suspect. Her name is Jordan Karfton, and she lives on Shula Lane. How did the snake removal go?"
LARRY, Eeeeeee!
LARRY, It was good. It was good.
GREG," Ms. Karfton, you don't know us, but-"
JORDAN," Uh, yeah, I do. I got you on video looking like a couple of dumbasses."
LARRY, I like to think I handled it with some amount of grace.
JORDAN," Nope, you looked dumber than my kid Jaden, and his eyes are perma-crossed. You want to see? Hey, Jaden!"
GREG," No, that's not necessary. Have you posted that video to the Internet?"
JORDAN, Not yet. Ran out of data on my phone because of all the porn I watched.
LARRY, We don't know each other. You could've just said you were out of data.
JORDAN, I'm uploading the video tomorrow at my cousin's wedding. Dog track has free Wi-Fi.
LARRY," Would you ever consider not uploading it and deleting it instead? If our boss sees that video, we could be fired."
JORDAN, I don't care about you. A great viral video like that could fetch me ten grand. And do you know what type of tanning bed I could get for that kind of money? A mid-range one.
GREG, Not necessary. Your tan is great as-is. You look like an evenly-stained deck.
JORDAN," All right, dude. Keep it in your pants. Like, I get why you're into this, and I could see something going on with us later, but right now, I need the cash."
LARRY," Wait, what if we gave you the $10,000?"
JORDAN," Make it 15, you got a deal."
LARRY, Fine. Meet us tonight at the Fun Zone. 8:00.
JORDAN, I will. Wear something cute.
GREG, We don't have that kind of money.
LARRY, Don't worry. I still have a few tricks up my sleeve. The only thing I need you to do is-
GREG, I'm not gonna show you my tattoo.
LARRY," Come on, just give me a hint. Is it an antique boat? Is it a musket? Is it me on a dragon?"
LARRY," Sir, is it me on a dragon?"
LARRY," Boom. $15,000 cash."
GREG, Wow. How'd you get it?
GREG," Oh, you didn't. You just stuck a few 20s around a bunch of corn dog coupons."
LARRY," Smart, right?"
GREG, What if she decides to count it?
LARRY," Oh, I'm not too worried about that. She doesn't strike me as a big counter."
GREG," Oh, well, that's quite an assumption. So- so this is your big plan. Oh, we need to call this off."
LARRY," No, this is our best shot."
LARRY," And right now, it's our only shot."
JORDAN," Where's my money, bitch?"
LARRY, Charming. I see you brought friends.
JORDAN," Oh, yeah, for backup."
LARRY," Well, here is your money."
LARRY, It's all there if you want to count it.
JORDAN," Hey, I graduated high school. I don't have to prove to you I can count."
LARRY, Of course not. Of course not.
JORDAN, Here's the phone. You can delete the video.
LARRY, Thank you- pictures
JORDAN," Hey, Billy, check it out. I'ma stick $1,000 out of my zipper."
JORDAN," Hey, what the hell? This isn't real money. Hey, give me my phone."
LARRY, You're gonna have to catch me first.
LARRY, Argh!
JORDAN, You really thought that would work? This video is going viral. And you-
JORDAN, This can still happen anytime. You know where I live.
GREG, You okay?
LARRY," Yeah. A little sore, but-"
GREG," Good. Then I can excoriate you freely. You half-assed living in Florida, and you half-assed getting the phone back. You've probably blown our cover, which means the marshals will have to move us. And when they do, I'm gonna demand they send us to different cities, because I don't want you anywhere near me."
LARRY, I swapped the phones.
GREG, What?
LARRY, I got the video.
LARRY," Sorry. I won't bother you anymore. Bye, Greg."
GREG," Lastly, hole 13 on the mini golf course is missing, so tell all the players to just repeat hole 12. All right, dismissed."
MANAGER," Damn, Greg, you are killing it as assistant manager. I mean, having the idea to have people come in at 9:00 a.m. that has really helped business."
GREG," Yes, that is when the sign says we're open."
MANAGER," Yeah. Look, there's one other thing. Now that you're management, I need you to promise me that you're gonna lay off the drugs. Just a little I don't want to kill your whole stoney vibe or anything."
GREG, I'll try.
MANAGER," Thank you. You keep this up, and I genuinely believe that you could be night manager in, like, two to three years."
GREG, Yes.
GREG, Two or three years. Here. In Florida.
LARRY," Well, it's an all-terrain vehicle, so yeah, you can do doughnuts in your living room."
GREG," Hi, I hear you're the man to talk to about the XTR-XP 49789WJ8-09 Xtreme four-wheel drive Z-Cat."
LARRY," Sir, I'm gonna stop you right there. I think you might be more comfortable speaking with one of our other associates."
GREG," No, no, I need to talk to this particular associate and apologize for saying he half-assed his ATV sales technique."
LARRY," Well, that's very nice, but I've moved on, and I'm with customers, so, thanks."
GREG," These machines are death traps. If you purchase one, you will be maimed."
LARRY, You won't be maimed. Most of the injuries are internal. You know what? I'm gonna speak with this gentleman for one moment. I'm so sorry. Give me a second.
LARRY," Sir, can I speak with you over here?"
LARRY," What is this all about? I've been staying away from you; I got a job. I'm trying to make the best of it, just like you said."
GREG," Well, don't bother. Making the best of it sucks. I want to go home. This town is a crap circus."
LARRY," What has gotten into you? You clearly got the promotion like you wanted. Congratulations, by the way. The blue looks great on you."
GREG, The day we spent acting like cops and getting that video back was the only time I've felt alive since we've been down here.
LARRY, So what are you saying?
GREG, Can I take this for a test drive?
LARRY," Yeah, sure."
LARRY, The ignition is here-
GREG, I've ridden ATVs before antiquing in the Berkshires.
LARRY," Oh, my files. My beautiful files."
GREG," I've looked over what you've got. Given your resources, very impressive, but-"
LARRY," I know. It'll take me months to find Figgis, but we'll find him faster if we work together."
GREG, What if we don't find Figgis? What if Figgis finds us?
LARRY," But I thought you deleted the file. I was going to, but this camera phone camera is not the same kind of camera phone camera as I have, so I couldn't figure out how. But I'm glad I didn't. I say we post this video and use it to lure Figgis down here, making ourselves into bait."
LARRY," And once Figgis is here, we take him down, climb out of America's steaming orifice, and go home. I like the way you're thinking, Greg."
GREG, It's Holt. Captain Raymond Holt.
HOLT," Now come and get us, Figgis."
LARRY, Greg.
GREG, Larry.
LARRY, What's going on? Any idea why Marshal Haas called this special meeting?
GREG," I don’t know. Do you think she saw the video we put on the Internet to lure Jimmy Figgis down here? ""Corn Dog pewwwnd by Go Kart""."
LARRY," It's ""pwned,"" but that was really adorable."
GREG," Well, if she has, it would ruin our entire plan."
GREG, Here she comes.
MARSHAL, Gentlemen.
LARRY, What's up?
MARSHAL, So how’s it going?
LARRY," It's good. It's really good. Uh, keeping a low prof. No contact with Brooklyn. No one's questioned our identities. Definitely staying off the Net, right, Greg?"
GREG, Right.
MARSHAL, That's it? That's all you have to say to me?
LARRY," Yep, I think we're good."
MARSHAL, So nobody's going to ask me how I’m doing?
GREG," Oh, I didn’t think this was a personal conversation."
MARSHAL," It's not; turn back around and watch the movie. This is official business. I was just testing you, because Greg is the kind of person who cares about his friends and can sense when something is off with them."
GREG," Is something off with you, Marshal Haas?"
MARSHAL," I don’t know. I mean, I met someone, okay, and, um I mean, it's not my husband, I mean, nothing's happened yet, but My entire body is on fire."
MARSHAL, He's Cuban.
LARRY, Is this still official business?
MARSHAL, Of course it is. Shut up and watch the movie.
LARRY, Yep.
MARSHAL, Pop quiz.
MARSHAL," If Larry were married and everything was fine, and I mean, honestly, everything is totally fine."
LARRY, Sure.
MARSHAL, But he knew that one night with this person could give him everything he needed for the rest of his life. Would he do it?
LARRY, Yes?
MARSHAL," Yes? Good. What if this person that Larry met was young? I mean, really young."
LARRY," Well, I don't think Larry would do anything illegal."
GREG," You know, it seems to me Larry has needs and deserves to have those needs met."
MARSHAL," Greg, you're really great at being undercover. You both passed the test."
MARSHAL, Marco! Vamanos!
AMY," Guys, guys, the marshal gave me good news about Jake."
CHARLES," Jake's back. Jake's back! Oh, we're not ready. We need gummy worms. We need them now!"
AMY," No, Charles. Jake is still wherever he is, but since it's been six months, the marshal is letting me write a one-page letter to Jake which she will read to him and then set on fire. Is there anything you guys want me to write?"
CHARLES," You have to tell Jake about my new son, Nikolaj. That he's four years old, he's from Latvia, he calls me ""comrade,"" and I love him so much."
AMY, Will do.
AMY," Rosa, anything you want to tell Jake?"
ROSA, Yeah. Tell him I said:
AMY, You want me to write that you nodded slightly?
ROSA, He'll know what it means.
GINA, I would like you to tell Jacob that I'm thinking about him and hoping that he's safe.
GINA," What? Meet the new Gina, who always puts others before herself. Can you make the whole letter about me doing that?"
AMY," Yeah, I'll just tell him that everything's exactly the same."
TERRY," Guys, briefing room, five minutes. We're getting a new captain. Again!."
GREG," Hello, Larry. It's your neighbor, Greg. Can I try your hot tub out? I'm thinking of getting one."
LARRY," Of course, that's a totally normal thing to do in 100 degree weather. Come on in and hop in the tub."
GREG, Thank you.
GREG, We need to talk without being overheard. Turn on the bubbles.
LARRY, You got it.
GREG," Jimmy ""The Butcher"" Figgis saw our video."
LARRY, How do you know?
GREG," A man with a thick New Jersey accent called the Fun Zone, asking to meet the guys from ""the corn dog video""."
LARRY, Figgis is coming to kill us. We should call the Nine-Nine for backup.
GREG," Oh, absolutely not. That might alert the marshals. We can take Figgis and his men down on our own."
LARRY, Right. Okay. Let's go arm up. Figgis has no idea what's about to hit him.
LARRY," Also it probably goes without saying, but it's chill to whiz in this thing."
LARRY," I mean, I have been. You can if you want. I haven't been if you haven't. Have you? I haven't. Have you?"
GREG," We can't just waltz in there and buy whatever we want. They'll do a federal background check on Greg Stickney and Larry Sherbert, and that will set off alarms in the marshal's office. No, we'll have to bribe the gun store owner so he doesn't run our names."
LARRY, But we don't have any money.
LARRY," Oh, my God. I'm the bribe, aren't I?"
GREG, You're not the bribe.
LARRY," Why, what's wrong with my body?"
GREG," Actually I borrowed $3,000 from my walking group friend Ruth."
GREG," Ruth, I'm going to be straight with you. I accidentally knocked up a woman."
RUTH, Greg!
GREG, You know me. I see a pair of thick weighty breasts and all logic flies out the window.
LARRY, Heterosexual you is such a dog.
STORE OWNER, Can I help you?
LARRY," Ah, no thanks, just browsing. Although, you know what, since I'm here, why don't I grab, like, eight handguns, couple of shotguns, and, I don't know, three more handguns."
STORE OWNER, Can I see some ID?
LARRY," Yes, of course, of course."
LARRY, Oh. Would you look at that?
LARRY," I forgot my license, but I do happen to have this big old wad-"
STORE OWNER, No problem.
LARRY, Hmm?
STORE OWNER, I don't need your ID. Federal database is down anyway. Wink wink.
LARRY, Ah.
STORE OWNER, So how do you like your ammo? By the box or by the bucket?
LARRY," Cool, cool, cool, cool. Our country is broken."
STORE OWNER, What?
LARRY, Bucket! I'll just take your biggest bucket of bullets.
TERRY," Okay, everyone. We've been assigned a new commander. Please give him a warm welcome."
STENTLEY," Hey, guys. I'm Captain Stentley. Ah, yuck, that sounds so formal. Um... Captain Jason. No."
ROSA," Yeah, you wearing sweat pants?"
SCULLY, I like this guy.
AMY," Uh, if I may ask, how did you become captain? You just seem a little, uh..."
AMY," No. No, no, no, no."
SCULLY AND HITCHCOCK, Amen.
TERRY, Not really.
CHARLES," Didn't you have to pass the exams? Like, wasn't there, like, an interview where they met you and heard you speak?"
GINA," Geej? Hi, Gina Linetti here."
GINA," What I need is an assistant of my own, just to do my paperwork and all my other work."
GINA, And I will help you with that.
GINA," I love him. He's the best captain we've ever had, hands down."
LARRY, We're gonna get out of Florida.
GREG, I don't know what you're so excited about. We have dangerous task ahead of us.
LARRY," Wait, I thought you said we didn't need backup. Are you worried? Do we need to call the Nine-Nine?"
GREG," No, no, no, no. We have the drop on Figgis, we're fully armed up, and we have plenty of time to lay a trap."
LARRY," Well, okay, then. See you around, Coral Palms. Adios, constant pool of sweat in my taint!"
LARRY," You do one, Greg."
GREG," All right. See you never, drive-through vape station."
LARRY," Adios, weird Juggalo encampment!"
GREG," Bye-bye, slightly askew stop sign."
GREG, Whoa-oh.
LARRY," Oh, come on, for running a stop sign? We just passed someone driving with both feet out the window."
GREG," Just be cool, Larry."
SHERIFF, Gentlemen. I am going to need to see your license and registration.
LARRY, Yeah.
SHERIFF," Whoa, hold on. What do we got going on back there?"
LARRY," Oh, uh, yesterday's newspaper."
SHERIFF," No, I'm talking about the pile of guns and the bucket of bullets."
LARRY," Right, right, right."
GREG," Right, right, yeah."
LARRY," Bucket of bullets, sure, sure."
SHERIFF, I need you both to step out of the vehicle.
LARRY," Yep, it'd be weird if you didn't."
LARRY," This is a little bit weird. Never been arrested before. I mean, I was ""detained"" once by Taylor Swift's security team, but that was a misunderstanding. She's probably going to write a song about me."
GREG, We got to get out of here. Figgis could show up at any minute. Don't worry. We can outsmart some small-town sheriff. We're NYPD detectives. We caught the Son of Sam. Ice-T plays us on TV. We keep the Tony's safe.
SHERIFF," Hey, fellas. Listen, I am sorry about the delay. We are overwhelmed here today."
SHERIFF," We hired our first woman, so of course she needs her own bathroom and the shirt don't fit right- the whole thing's chaos."
LARRY," It's not a problem, Sheriff. You have nothing to worry about."
AMY," I think we all agree that C.J. is, to put it mildly, not very impressive."
TERRY, I watched him try to close the blinds in his office for 40 minutes. He finally just gave up and changed his pants with the windows wide open.
AMY," Something has to be done, and I have a plan. We use mankind's greatest weapon."
ROSA, A grenade.
AMY, The written word.
ROSA," Ugh, I'm out."
AMY," I drafted a letter to One Police Plaza saying that we think Captain Stentley is not a good fit for our precinct. If we all sign it, they'll have to act."
EMILY," Hey, guys, I'm Emily, Gina's assistant."
AMY," Wait, she actually got that?"
EMILY," ""Wait, she actually got that?"""
EMILY," Sorry, I'm under strict orders from Gina to mock you whenever I see an opening. Follow me, please."
EMILY, Your 2:00 is here.
GINA," Okay, thanks, Em, and while I'm in this meeting, will you just shred some documents for me? Anything you see. It's all garbage."
EMILY, On it.
TERRY, What's going on? We were busy.
GINA," Busy trying to ruin everything around here with your dumb letter? This is a gravy train, people. Okay, C.J. will say yes to anything we ask for. Rosa, dare to dream. What do you want?"
ROSA, For him to be gone.
GINA, You want that more than you want walls around your desk so Hitchcock can't stare at you with his big old google eyes anymore?
ROSA, C.J. stays. I love that guy.
GINA, Yes!
AMY, What?
HITCHCOCK, That's not fair!
AMY, Come on.
GINA," And how about you, Charles? What do you want, baby boy?"
CHARLES," Well, I agree with Amy that C.J. is totally unqualified and a disaster for the precinct, and I would really love a treadmill desk so I can hit my cardio targets."
GINA, Done.
CHARLES, Yes!
AMY, Boyle.
CHARLES, I'm sorry. I'm doing it for Nikolaj. You'll understand once you bear unto Jake a child.
GINA," Looks like you're all alone. Em, can you go ahead and show her out?"
EMILY," Right this way, please, and can I validate your parking?"
AMY, I work here.
SHERIFF," So, listen, do you mind if I ask you a few questions? It shouldn't take much time."
LARRY," Great, because we actually have someplace important to be, so if it would speed things up, we're happy to waive our right to counsel."
SHERIFF," Wow, counsel, the ""C"" word."
SHERIFF," Wait, wait, wait. You guys in law enforcement?"
LARRY," No, no, no. I just have a buddy who's a detective in the NYPD."
SHERIFF," Whoo, I bet he's better than me at getting people to talk. Everything I know about interrogation I learned from ""The Newlywed Game""."
LARRY, Huh.
SHERIFF," So, look, why don't you each write down your answer to these questions."
SHERIFF," Okay, question one, what were you going to use the guns for? Okay, and then read 'em out when you're done."
GREG AND LARRY, Hunting.
SHERIFF," Okay, see, I knew you boys were on the level. Okay, question two: What do you hunt?"
LARRY, Deer.
GREG, Grouse and other small fowl.
SHERIFF, Oh.
LARRY," Yep, we hunt everything. You know, deer, grouse, a horse once."
GREG," Yes, we love killing any animal."
SHERIFF," I hear ya. Okay, question three: You said you had somewhere important to go, so where exactly is that?"
GREG, Dinner date.
LARRY, Dinner date. That's what mine says as well. Sorry about the handwriting.
LARRY," The point is, neither of us are lying. Should we just pick up our keys on the way out, or how do you want to do this?"
SHERIFF," No one has ever beaten ""The Newlywed Game"". No one."
AMY," Hey, Diaz."
AMY, Right. The walls.
ROSA, Can I help you?
AMY, I need the crime stats from last month.
ROSA, Fine. One sec.
CHARLES," Some people, huh?"
CHARLES," Hey, I'm up to 20,000 steps."
AMY," Seriously, Boyle?"
CHARLES," Oh, you don't care about my health? You don't care about if Nikolaj grows up without a papa? You want me to die?"
AMY, Honestly? A little.
CHARLES, Hurts.
AMY," I can't believe they all let C.J. and Gina just buy them off. But we don't need them, 'cause we've got you, and you're a sergeant. Did you sign the letter yet?"
TERRY, Um I-
AMY, What did he give you?
TERRY," He gave me the ability to continue to serve this community unencumbered by a necessary oversight. Now, I really have to-"
AMY, What did he give you?
TERRY," He gave me a yogurt fridge, all right?"
TERRY," I asked for a yogurt fridge, and I got one, right next to my desk! I'm only a man."
AMY, I'm sending this letter with or without your signature. Enjoy your blood yogurt.
TERRY, I will.
LARRY, Time is running out. We have the right to a phone call. We need to call the Nine-Nine so they can sort this out with the sheriff.
GREG," No, they would want to get involved and that could endanger them."
LARRY, They'd be okay with that. Charles and Amy both love me. Rosa's not scared of anything. I'm like a mentor to Terry.
GREG," No, regardless, we don't have time for that. We just have to tell the truth."
GREG," Sheriff, I'm ready to talk."
SHERIFF, This better be good. I'm a busy man.
GREG, You just spent 30 minutes trying to win a radio contest.
SHERIFF, For my wife. They're giving away Swampsgiving tickets.
GREG," I'm not really Greg, and that's not Larry."
HOLT, We're Captain Raymond Holt and Detective Jake Peralta of the NYPD.
JAKE," We've been targeted by Jimmy ""The Butcher"" Figgis, the mafia boss. We're in witness protection, and that is the full truth."
SHERIFF, Good one. That's a good one.
HOLT, Just call the U.S. marshal who handles our case. She'll explain everything.
SHERIFF, She?
SHERIFF," Oh, come on. This is getting crazier by the second. But I'll tell you, I kind of want to see how it plays out."
SHERIFF," Well, it's a guy, and he says he's never heard of either one of you."
JAKE, That's impossible.
SHERIFF, Listen for yourself.
JAKE, Hello.
FIGGIS, It's Figgis.
FIGGIS," I have your marshal, and I'm coming for you. See you soon, Jake."
JAKE, Wait.
JAKE, Great news.
JAKE, I found Figgis.
JAKE," This is bad. Figgis has the marshal, and now he knows where we are. We're sitting ducks. That's the worst kind of duck."
HOLT, Tell that to the Dutch Hookbill.
JAKE," Look, the clock is ticking. We only have one option. Jailbreak."
HOLT, And how do you propose to pull that off?
JAKE, By using this rag-tag team of inmates. Our very own Suicide Squad.
JAKE," All right, let's rally the troops."
JAKE," Hey, fellow prisoners. Hi, there. Everyone, look, we haven't connected as much as maybe we should have. That's our fault. Why don't I just kick things off."
JAKE," I'm Jake, and I like baseball."
JAKE, Now you say something about yourself.
HOLT, I'm Raymond. I don't care for baseball.
JAKE," Great, so now that we're all ""vibing"" at 100, quick question: If there were to a be a jailbreak ""of sorts,"" how many of you guys would be interested in that? Obviously if you have any moral objection-"
JAKE," Okay, your hands are already all up, so I say we hop on this pony. Great. Now, do any of you have any special skills? Maybe the ability to pick a lock?"
MITCH," Uh, I'm Mitch. I have a glass eye."
JAKE, Glass eye? We'll definitely find some use for that.
JAKE," How about you, sir?"
EVAN," I'm Evan. I've been arrested for a lot of different stuff: public urination, urinating on private property"
JAKE, Uh huh.
EVAN, Urinating 25 feet from a school
JAKE, Okay.
EVAN, Urinating out of a moving truck.
HOLT, I don't think Evan gets what we're doing here.
JAKE," Oh, doesn't he? He's been here for weeks. He knows the guard's comings and goings."
JAKE," Thank you for sharing, Evan. You are valued here."
JAKE," Your turn, old-timer."
JAKE, It's always guys like this that unlock the entire operation.
JAKE, What do you bring to the table?
TITO, I'm Tito. I'm great at smoking meth.
JAKE, And?
TITO, Snorting meth.
JAKE, And?
TITO, I haven't spoken to my daughter in a couple of years.
JAKE," Oh, that's so sad. Okay, so find something for Tito to do."
AMY," So I heard from One Police Plaza. They received my letter, and apparently they also received hundreds of others in support of C.J."
GINA," Yeah, Emily and I sent those in, so... Emily, what was that burn I had you write down for Amy because I didn't want to forget it?"
EMILY," ""Why so sad? Did you just find out American Girl doesn't make clothes in adult sizes?"""
GINA, No.
EMILY," ""Steven Seagal called and he wants his ponytail back""?"
GINA, Huh-uh.
EMILY," ""Gina: Hey, Amy, what did one graphing calculator say to the other one? Amy: What? Gina: Why does the sad lady own two of us?"""
GINA," ""Own two of us""! That's it!"
GINA," Hey, Amy."
AMY, You know what? Congratulations. You just made sure that a terrible captain will be sticking around here indefinitely.
TERRY," Come on, Santiago. We're just trying to make the best of it."
TERRY, Yogurt?
AMY, Never!
CHARLES," Yes! 40,000 steps!"
AMY, Boyle!
CHARLES, I can't talk. I got to keep my heart rate up.
ROSA," Hey, can you guys keep it down? Need a roof on this thing. Gina, I need a roof."
GINA, Emily.
EMILY, On it.
AMY," Listen, you selfish jerks, that guy in there, the one playing the bongos right now."
AMY," He thinks we're killing it, so he's just staying out of our way."
AMY," He always inspired us to work harder and smarter, to be better. And if he were here right now, he'd be ashamed of us."
CHARLES," Amy, wait!"
CHARLES," Oh! Ah! Ooh, ah!"
JAKE, You swear this guy's about to meet up with his mistress?
EVAN, Yep. Tuesday at 5:00. It's Tanya time.
JAKE," Well, there he goes. Okay, now we got to get rid of the other deputy. Glass eye, you're up."
JAKE," Oh, so much drier than I would have thought. Did I want it to be wet?"
HOLT, Jake!
JAKE, Right! Sorry. Just holding an eyeball in my hand. No big deal. Here we go.
JAKE, Yah.
SHERIFF, Okay.
JAKE," And great. Now we stage a fight; when the sheriff comes in to break it up, we take him down."
HOLT, Ah!
SHERIFF, We got us a jail fight.
JAKE, Yah!
HOLT, Why isn't he coming in?
JAKE," I don't know, maybe he's not buying it. Hit me harder."
JAKE, Oh!
SHERIFF," Damn, you knocked him."
HOLT, What would it take for him to intervene? Do I actually have to kill you?
JAKE," No, he'd probably love that."
HOLT, Ugh!
JAKE," But you know what he would hate? Okay, just go with me on this, all right?"
JAKE, Ugh.
JAKE, I can't stay mad at you.
SHERIFF, Ooh! No! No!
JAKE, Is it working?
SHERIFF, Break it up.
HOLT, I think so.
SHERIFF," Not in my jail. No, no."
SHERIFF, Break it up! Whoa!
SHERIFF, Stop it! What are you doing?
HOLT," It's 2016, man. This is on you."
TITO," Hey, wait a minute. You didn't give me anything to do."
JAKE, You have the most important job of all. Tell everyone what you saw here today.
TITO," Oh, God bless you. You're giving an old meth head a reason to live forever and-"
JAKE," We don't have time for this, Tito!"
TERRY," Hey, Santiago, come with me a sec."
AMY," Why? So you can show off some new cool thing that C.J. got you? Let me guess, golden suspenders?"
TERRY, Can you imagine? I would look amazing. But that's not what I came here for. Just follow me to the captain's office.
TERRY," Okay, so we wanted to talk to you, Captain Stentley because-"
TERRY, No. You're our boss.
TERRY," No, sir. It's just that the squad feels we've been taking advantage of you, and it has to stop. So I returned my yogurt fridge."
CHARLES, I gave my treadmill desk back.
ROSA, I took down my desk walls.
GINA, And I have agreed to fire my assistant's assistant Dana.
AMY, Dana? Who's Dana?
GINA, Emily had a lot on her plate.
TERRY," Well, if you want to do that, start acting like a real captain."
TERRY," Yeah, that's progress."
ROSA, I gotta go.
JAKE," I can't believe we're fugitives on the lam, falsely accused of a crime."
HOLT, There's nothing false about it. We committed several felonies and escaped from jail.
JAKE," Yeah, but we were just doing what we had to do. We're the good guys."
JAKE, This is what they all think.
HOLT," Figgis is in town, and we have no car, no money, no guns; we can't go back to our houses because the police are looking for us."
JAKE, It's time to call the Nine-Nine.
HOLT, Absolutely not.
JAKE, What is going on with you?
HOLT," Nothing, I just think that we can do it alone."
JAKE," Sir, we just shared one of the longest kisses of my life. I think we can be honest with each other."
HOLT," All right. The Nine-Nine bailed me out once before when I was taken hostage by Bob, a man I had put my trust in, like a fool. I don't want them to rescue me again. It's embarrassing. I need to clean up my own mess."
JAKE," Captain, it's the Nine-Nine. There's nothing wrong with asking for help from people that care about you."
TERRY, This is Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
TERRY, Captain Holt!
TERRY, Sir. Captain Stentley.
TERRY," There's an urgent situation, and we need 72 hours off to go to Florida. Now, I can't say why-"
AMY, What?
TERRY," The Eight-Six said they would cover for us, and this very important!"
AMY," Sorry, guys. I kinda feel like this is my fault."
EMILY," ""I kinda feel like this is my fault""."
GINA," Not now, Emily."
HOLT," The cops are looking for us, and a madman wants us dead. We should be laying low until the Nine-Nine gets here."
JAKE," Yeah, but we don’t know when that's gonna be, and we need food and supplies."
HOLT," Okay, I’ll get some water."
JAKE," Holt, are you trying to draw attention to us? Nobody drinks water here. Choose something blue or green."
HOLT," Okay, I guess I'll go in for, uh, the Blazing Blue Rad-berry Cooler Xtreme: Code Rad."
JAKE," Good choice. (Jake turns and picks up two cans of body spray) I should probably get some body spray as well. What sounds better, Liquid Moan or Turnpike?"
HOLT, We only have $17 to our name. We can't spend five of it on this.
JAKE," I know, but I'm about to see Amy for the first time in forever, and I want to smell like a (Jake pauses and reads one of the sprays) ""Hot New Jersey breeze,"" ugh."
JAKE," Good call. All right, let’s get out of here."
SLADE," And in Coral Palms, law enforcement still is searching for a pair of fugitives who broke out of jail earlier this evening. (The screen shows Jake and Holt's faces. They both lower their caps) Greg Stickney and Larry Sherbet are believed to be unarmed but dangerous."
CASHIER," Liquid Moan, nice. I wore this to Swampsgiving last year cleaned up."
JAKE," Right on, bro."
CASHIER," Oh, we have a promotion on the Code Rad. It comes with a free cigarette."
JAKE," Oh, no. That doesn't matter. We don't need it."
CASHIER," Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it."
JAKE," No, no, no. Don't do that smoking is bad. You should quit smoking right now."
CASHIER, Hey Ahh.
HOLT, We seem to be in the clear. Are you hurt?
JAKE, Yeah. I got caught on top of the fence. Check out my calf it's like Scratch City. (We see Jake's legs with a few scratches down them) How about you?
HOLT," I'm fine, except I was impaled on a metal pipe."
JAKE," Oh, my God! (Jake looks away, pauses, then looks back) Oh, my God! (He blinks and then looks away again)."
JAKE," It's gonna be fine. (Jake then looks at Holt's leg again) Oh, my God!"
ROSA," I got rifles, vests, flash grenades"
SCULLY," Chips, dips, ice cream sammies"
AMY," I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully."
SCULLY," Pretty sure? Do you arrest someone if you're pretty sure they're guilty? (Scully pauses) No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!"
CHARLES," Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission."
ROSA, Really? Then what (Rosa picks up a large photo book from Charles' pile) is this?
CHARLES," Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake."
TERRY," All right, bad news. I talked to Captain Stentley again. He still won't give us permission to go to Florida. I even brought out the big guns."
TERRY," Terry feels like a whore. He said if we disobey him, there'll be ""tire"" consequences. (Terry pauses) I think he meant dire. Guy's real dumb."
TERRY," Who's with me? (Hitchcock raises his hand) Great, Hitchcock's in. Who else?"
HITCHCOCK, I actually had a question. How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
AMY," Shut up, Hitchcock. Obviously, we're all going."
GINA," What's up, squadron? I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so (She starts laughing) let's take it to the skies."
TERRY," Yeah, about that. Um, there were no tickets left. But I brought my minivan, so"
CHARLES, Road trip!
JAKE, I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies. I was in and out like a ninja.
JAKE," Needles, needles, need- (The stool slips from under him and he grabs onto the shelves, pulling them down on top of him) whoa!"
JAKE, So many dogs!
HOLT, I'll need your assistance. You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
JAKE," All right. This is gonna hurt. But I'm gonna get you through it. (Jake grabs the pipe but wretches) Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut. (Jake then turns to face the other way) Ahhh, I saw inside of you. How are humans alive?"
HOLT," Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?(Jake covers his mouth and nods) We'll get you through this."
JAKE, Okay.
JAKE," Ugh, what was that sound? I did not like that squish sound."
HOLT," The pipe has been removed. Now I'm sewing myself up. (Jake exhales and Holt grabs a stitching kit) Okay, this is almost over. You're doing great. Just keep talking. Keep talking."
JAKE, Talking about what?
HOLT," Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm? You must be excited to see her."
JAKE," Very much, you know. Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well? We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird? (Jake turns around to see Holt sewing himself up) Uhhh! (He turns back around)"
HOLT," Keep going, keep going. You're doing so well. Why would it be weird?"
JAKE," I don't- I don't know. I mean, maybe we've grown apart. Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips. I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time."
HOLT, I'm sure it will be magical when you see her. And guess what?
JAKE, What?
HOLT, I'm done. I've sewn myself up.
JAKE, Huh.
HOLT," You did great, buddy. I'm proud of you."
JAKE, I can't believe I did it. I'm so strong.
AMY," Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."
AMY," Fun fact: Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth."
ROSA," Oof, poor Jake."
GINA," Uhh, this might be the Ambies speaking, but this in-flight movie sucks."
CHARLES," So, uh, (Charles picks up a booster seat) you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh? Aren't they a little young for that?"
TERRY, They're four.
CHARLES," Nikolaj is four, but we're sticking with the car seat as long as possible, but you know me I'm a ""safety at all costs"" kind of dad."
TERRY, Mm-hmm.
SCULLY," Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom."
TERRY, We just stopped for gas. I asked you if you had to go.
SCULLY, I didn't have to then.
CHARLES, So does this van have side-impact airbags?
TERRY, Not in the back.
CHARLES, Oh. Interesting. (Charles pauses and then leans back) No judgment here.
ROSA," Sarge, I have to pee now too."
TERRY," Seriously? You, Diaz? Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?"
ROSA, I have to pee really badly.
HITCHCOCK, Hot.
CHARLES, What?
AMY," Gross, Hitchcock!"
TERRY," Guys, enough!"
ROSA, Sarge-
TERRY," Yeah, I know! You got to pee, I got it!"
AMY," No, brake lights!"
TERRY," Oh, crap."
CHARLES, Everyone hang on! There's no side-impact airbags!
HOLT, Did you get breakfast?
JAKE," I tried, but I got recognized."
WOMAN, Do I know you from somewhere?
JAKE, Do you (He pauses) watch a lot of pornography? 'Cause (he pauses again) I'm in most of it.
HOLT," Oh, boy. What if you were followed? I don't think it's safe to stay here."
JAKE, Where are we gonna go?
HOLT, The cops?
JAKE, Or Figgis! Do we have any weapons?
HOLT, I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
JAKE, I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
JAKE," Oh, no, I'm gonna do it. (Disgusted, he picks up the metal pipe)"
JAKE, Oh!
AMY, Jake?
JAKE," Amy, (he struggles to breath) It's so good to see you."
JAKE, Thank you guys so much for coming. I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
HITCHCOCK," My dad died, and-"
JAKE," Again, when this is done, Hitchcock."
JAKE," Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it."
JAKE," So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him. The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them. Any questions?"
CHARLES," Yes, did you miss us? Quick follow-up: Did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?"
JAKE, Yes.
CHARLES, Knew it.
JAKE," All right, once we get to the Fun Zone, I'll fill everyone in on the mission details. (He points at the crew) You guys come with me. (He then turns to Holt) Captain, you stay here and rest."
HOLT, What? I don't need to rest. I'm in peak condition.
JAKE," All right, then stand up."
HOLT, Easy. I love standing up.
TERRY," Yeah, you're staying here."
GINA," Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay? My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay? Terry, I'm gonna need your gun."
TERRY, That's not happening.
GINA," All right, I'll use my own. (Gina pulls out a gin and everyone moves back except Rosa) Oops-a-daisy."
ROSA, That is adorable. Where did you get that?
GINA, Vending machine at a rest stop.
TERRY," Give me that. (He takes the gun off of Gina) Just don't let Captain Holt die. And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned. Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
JAKE," Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
AMY, Yeah. Hi.
JAKE, Hi.
CHARLES," Oh, my God, everyone, Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months. Let those Nicholas Sparks fly."
JAKE, So everyone's just gonna watch us?
CHARLES," Yes! Now get to it, you lovebirds."
CHARLES, Here we go.
AMY," Come on, man."
JAKE, How did you get there so fast?
CHARLES, Love finds a way.
AMY, Ugh.
JAKE," Welcome to the Fun Zone. I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
TERRY, Smart. You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
JAKE," No, those are actually always there something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
JAKE," Anyways, you all have your assignments. Let's plan an ambush. (He pumps his fist) Nine-Nine!"
EVERYONE, Nine-Nine!
JAKE," Chills, you guys. Literally, chills."
CHARLES," Hey there, Nikolaj. It's your papa. If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me. But I want you to know that I love you very much."
TERRY, You want to stop filming yourself and help me with these many items I'm carrying?
CHARLES," Sorry, I was making a video for my son. You know, in case I never see him again. (He then makes a confused face) Do you not do that for your kids?"
TERRY," Of course I do. I make those kind of videos all the time. (He then pulls out his own phone) You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now. (He presses record) Hey hey, girls. It's me, Daddy. If you're seeing this, I'm dead. But I want you to know that I love you now and forever."
CHARLES," Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian. Ligo! Ligo! Ligo!"
TERRY," Yeah, yeah, lullaby time. Look. (He starts singing) Go to sleep, Daddy's dead. But his ghost's always watching."
ROSA, What the hell are you guys doing?
JAKE," Good call. Blocking the door. Keep it up, smorty-pants."
AMY, Oh
JAKE," Uh Mwah. (He then kisses her on the forehead awkwardly) One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned."
AMY, This is weird.
JAKE, Should we have sex?
AMY, What?
JAKE, Huh?
AMY," Yeah. I mean, no."
JAKE," No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
AMY, Maybe we should just-
JAKE," You're right. Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
AMY," No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
JAKE, Ah.
AMY, We have the rest of our lives to talk.
JAKE," Yeah, unless he kills us first."
JAKE," What a weird joke. Regret saying that one. Wow, things are (he pauses) clickin'."
AMY, I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in- in the ball pit.
JAKE, Yup.
JAKE, Important to get on them balls. (he then talks to himself) What is wrong with me?
GINA," So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like, ""At this point, I hate you"". I'm like, ""Oh, really? 'Cause you didn't hate me last week""."
HOLT, Trevor sounds like a dog.
GINA," Right? God, I missed our daily dishes."
HOLT," Me too. I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss'"" of my own. I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine."
GINA," Sir, they're gonna be fine."
HOLT, They're my squad. I should be there with them. This is killing me.
GINA," Well, I'm not gonna let it. (She stands up and takes the blanket off)Let's go."
HOLT," But my wound, Gina."
GINA," Sir, with your brain and my body (she pauses slightly) and my brain we make one unstoppable unit. Now climb aboard, sir. (She walks round him, squats down, and Holt puts his arms around her) And let's go. (She picks him up on her back but they both quickly fall to the ground) Oof."
JAKE," All right, everybody ready?"
JAKE, Good. Let's set this trap.
FIGGIS, Hello.
JAKE," Hello, Figgis."
FIGGIS, Peralta.
FIGGIS, Congratulations on escaping prison.
JAKE, Thank you.
JAKE, Congrats on sucking.
FIGGIS," You know, I'm bored. I'd love to kill you tonight. So where you hiding?"
JAKE, Wouldn't you like you know?
ARCADE MACHINE, Round one.
JAKE, You're never gonna find me.
JAKE, I'm invisible.
YOUNG GIRL," Mommy, I won!"
ARCADE MACHINE, Downtown!
JAKE," I'm everywhere, and I'm nowhere."
JAKE, And I'm coming for you.
JAKE," Peace out, loser."
FIGGIS, He's at the Fun Zone. Gear up.
JAKE," This ends tonight. (Without looking, Jake throws it backwards. The basket ball bounces off a metal frame and hits Amy in the head) Uh!"
AMY, Ow!
JAKE," Oh, sorry, babe."
AMY, What were you aiming for?
JAKE, Hey.
AMY, Hey.
JAKE," Got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling. (He hands the bag to her) I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine."
AMY, Cool.
JAKE, Yeah.
AMY, Why do we keep hurting each other?
JAKE, I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it. It just feels like we're not-
AMY, On the same page.
JAKE, Clicking.
JAKE, That was basically the same thing. I count that.
AMY, Yeah.
JAKE," Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just want us to be normal again."
AMY," Yeah, me too."
JAKE, I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.
AMY, What?
JAKE, Why did I say that?
AMY, Why did you kiss Holt?
JAKE," I didn't. I did. We (he pauses) did it to get out of jail, but it didn't mean anything. Just forget I said anything, right? Rewind. (He then makes noises, mimicking a rewinding tape) And kiss."
AMY, Jake-
JAKE," You want to know if there was tongue. I can tell you, decidedly there was not."
AMY," No, Jake. Figgis is here."
JAKE," Okay, well, good talk. Don't die. Holt had very soft lips. Wish I hadn't said that one either. We should get into positions."
AMY," Yeah, okay."
JAKE," Hey, kill the lights! Figgis is here!"
STORAGE WORKER," Excuse me, ma'am, this dolly's being used."
GINA, Broccoli Che visto?
STORAGE WORKER, It's being used.
GINA, Quanti erala Vito la Bella? Tutto matro lamente?
STORAGE WORKER, Just bring it back when you're done.
GINA, Ah! (She starts walking backwards with the dolly) Garbanzo marinara! Pizzeri­a restaurante! Ahh!
GINA, Jackpot. Let's do this.
HOLT, And how am I supposed to get all the way up there?
GINA, Gracefully.
HOLT, Boost my bottom!
GINA, I'm boosting!
HOLT, Boost my bottom!
GINA, I'm boosting!
HOLT, Boost it!
GINA, Ah. All right stick shift. (She pauses and looks at Holt) I can't drive stick shift. You're gonna have to drive.
HOLT, How? My leg doesn't work.
GINA," Sir, I am a dancer. I will be your legs."
HOLT, Clutch in.
GINA, Okay.
HOLT, Clutch out.
HOLT, Oh!
GINA, Hoo-hoo! We are the best driver in the world!
FIGGIS, Spread out and find 'em.
SCULLY, Bogie headed to the ball pit.
MUSIC, Is that all you got? I'll take your best shot
MUSIC," I'll take your best shot, I'll take your best shot! Boom"
MUSIC, Here comes the. Boom. Ready or not.
MUSIC, Here comes the boys from the South. Is that all you got?
MUSIC, I'll take your best shot.
MUSIC," Well, it's all right. I'll take your best shot. I'll take your best shot."
MUSIC," Boom. Here comes the boom. Ready or not, ha ha, how you like me now?"
FIGGIS, Peralta. Holt. I know you're here. I'm gonna kill you.
JAKE, I don't think so.
FIGGIS, Oh
JAKE," Put down the weapon, Figgis."
JAKE," There you go. Oh, yes. I've been waiting for this moment a long time. You ruined my life. I had to live in Florida for six months!"
FIGGIS, It's the worst. Have you tried the pizza down here?
JAKE," Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. It somehow burned my mouth and is cold at the same time. But none of that changes the fact that you're about to go to prison for the rest of your life."
SHERIFF," Drop it, Sherbet!"
JAKE, What? No!
SHERIFF," I've been everywhere, and I finally spotted your minivan with the New York plates parked around back. We already got all your friends. So drop it."
JAKE, You don't understand. I'm a detective with the NYPD. This is Jimmy Figgis; he's wanted by the FBI.
FIGGIS," No, I'm Constantine Binvoglio, and I came here to repair a skee ball machine on the the fritz, but suddenly he's trying to kill me."
JAKE," He's lying. ""Constantine Binvoglio"". It's clearly a name he just made up. I'm very impressed. That was pretty good."
SHERIFF," I will shoot you, Sherbet."
JAKE," All right, fine, I will put down my weapon, but you have to promise me you will not let this man go."
SHERIFF," Okay, well, we're gonna cuff everyone, and then we're gonna sort this all out."
JAKE, Thank you.
FIGGIS," Yeah, thanks, Sheriff."
JAKE, No!
FIGGIS, Now let's me and you take a little walk.
SHERIFF, Ooh.
JAKE," How do you think you're getting out of this, Figgis? Do you even have a plan?"
FIGGIS," I'm gonna hold you hostage to get away. Then I'm gonna drive to a gas station where I'll steal a clean car and head for the airport, where I'll buy a ticket with my false ID, then kill you in the parking lot and disappear again."
JAKE, Pfft. You're scrambling.
TERRY," Look, I told you, we're NYPD."
CHARLES," I can prove it. Look up ""Brooklyn detective attacked by birds"". You'll see an article with a photo of me."
ROSA," (Whispering to Amy) I'm gonna give you a window, and you're gonna go after Jake. (She then walks towards the officer) My name is Detective Rosa Diaz, NYPD."
ROSA, I'm reaching for my badge.
FIGGIS, Keep walking.
AMY, Let him go.
FIGGIS," Put that gun down, or he dies."
JAKE, He's not gonna shoot me. He needs me alive to get out of here.
FIGGIS," Yeah, you willing to take that bet? I wouldn't. Now put the gun down."
JAKE, Oh!
FIGGIS, You shot him!
AMY, Are you okay? I'm sorry I shot you. I thought that's what the nod meant.
JAKE," It was. It was awesome. It was actually just like the end of ""Speed"", which is a pretty good movie. It's not as good as ""Die Hard"". ""Die Hard""'s perf-"
AMY," Okay, Jake, I'm gonna go after Figgis."
JAKE," Yeah, I was gonna say, you should keep going after Figgis. Same page, still."
AMY, Get out of the car!
GINA, Young Jeezy take the wheel!
HOLT," Freeze, punk!"
GINA," Yeah, freeze, punk!"
HOLT," Gina, where did you get that gun?"
GINA, Lost and found at the storage facility. They have boxes of 'em. They're everywhere.
ROSA," Hey, Figgis. My fiancé, Adrian Pimento, said when I caught you, I should read you this letter. (Rosa pulls out a not) ""I want to lick the skin off your body, baby"". Oh, that side's for me. (She turns the note over) ""I want to rip the skin off your body, Jimmy""."
TERRY," We're sorry we doubted you, sir. You really saved our butts."
HOLT, I can't take credit for that. Gina Linetti is the real hero here.
GINA," But isn't Gina Linetti more of a state of mind? Like, in a way, we were all Gina Linetti today. (She turns to the EMT) Gina, let's take this Gina to the hospital."
JAKE," Hey, how's the sheriff?"
AMY," Well, he keeps yelling, ""Disability for life!"" So I think he's fine. Also, Coral Palms PD found your marshal at Figgis's hideout, alive at well."
JAKE," Oh, that's great."
AMY, Yeah. How are you doing?
JAKE," Fine you know, just getting bandaged up. (He turns to the EMT) Actually, can you give us a second? Thanks."
JAKE, It hurts so bad. I just didn't want to seem weak in front of EMT Craig.
AMY," So I know this is weird to say, because I just shot you, but it feels like we're back in sync now."
JAKE," Yeah, I mean, as in sync as I've ever been with someone who just shot me."
AMY, I love you.
JAKE," I love you too. Hey, do you happen to know my blood type?"
AMY, Yeah. B positive.
JAKE," Well, guessed wrong. (He pulls a drip from his arm and shouts out the ambulance) Hey, Craig?"
GINA," Hey, Captain Stentley, we're back."
TERRY, It was fine.
HITCHCOCK, A lot of college girls.
ROSA," Come on, man."
TERRY," Now, before you say anything, I know we disobeyed a direct order-"
AMY," Oh, no, a memorandum of admonishment?"
ROSA, You were punishing us.
TERRY, Noooo!
JAKE," Hey, everyone. Sorry I'm late. So, what's this secret meeting all about? You guys know I'm not medically cleared for another week."
GINA," It's not a secret meeting, Jake. It's an intervention."
ROSA, The tips have to go.
JAKE, What? Why?
GINA," Jake, we're worried about you, and you look very stupid."
JAKE," C'mon, guys. I think they're kind of cool, retro."
TERRY," No, they're terrible."
JAKE," Amy, come on. You're digging the tips, right?"
AMY," No, I feel like I'm kissing Vanilla Ice."
JAKE, There was a time you would've jumped at that chance.
ROSA, They have to go.
JAKE," All right, you guys got me. I did it as a joke. I kept them ironically. Pretty funny, right? I'm just gonna head out."
GINA, Get him!
JAKE, No!
GINA," Yes, Terry!"
JAKE," Okay, okay. Wait, wait, okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I'll admit it. I went too deep down there in Florida. At one point, I think I forgot where the tip of me ended, and the base of the tips began. Before we just chop 'em off, 'would anybody like to say some final words?"
ROSA, No.
JAKE," That was one word. That counts. Thank you, Rosa. Okay, I'm ready."
CHARLES," Sorry I'm late everyone, but trust me, it's worth it. Me and Jake are tip buds. What? No!"
JAKE, No! You know what? I do see it. It's bad. It looks bad.
JAKE," Brace yourselves 'cause Jake-y is back. Don't everybody mob me at once. We can high-five one at a time. Oh, I see no response. A little ""welcome back to the precinct"" hazing. Who's behind this cute little prank? Diaz?"
ROSA, Kill yourself.
JAKE, Okay.
AMY, I told you. Night shift has everyone a little down.
TERRY," Yeah, just because you don't get to sleep or see your loved ones or feel the sun or do anything that brings you joy. That's all."
GINA, I personally like the night shift. You know who else is up right now?
JAKE, Murderers? Armed robbers?
GINA, Australians. It's an whole new demographic for me to conquer. I already have the third most followers behind Iggy Azalea and the Perth Zoo Wallaby cam.
JAKE," Wow, that's pretty good."
GINA," It's not just good, Jake. It's bonzer."
ROSA," Night shift is boring. Listen to the cases I've had: Drunk and disorderly, drunk and disorderly, cyber crime-"
JAKE," Ooh, cyber crime. Pretty cool."
ROSA, Caught a drunk guy humping a laptop.
JAKE," Well, we've all been there. But my point is this: I don't care what time it is. I'm always happy to be here. Nine-Nine! Nine-Niiine! A-Noine-Noine! I'm gonna keep doing it until you guys chime in. A-Noine-Noine!"
HOLT," Sergeant Jeffords, a word."
JAKE, What is wrong with everyone?
HOLT, I'm worried our night shift morale problem has gotten worse.
TERRY," Yeah, you think? I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. My wife says when I get tired, I get night sassy."
HOLT, Night sassy?
TERRY," Hearing problems, much? Sorry. Should I just go tell everyone to buck up and do their jobs?"
HOLT," No, the squad's only on night shift because they came down to Florida to save Jake and me. It's my responsibility to fix this, so I'm going to brighten the mood by telling a few jokes. Try this one on for size: I don't care for cheese. I'm a curd-mudgeon. Wow. You're too tired for humor."
CHARLES," If he isn't taking his medicine, you could mix it in with his food."
JAKE," Sorry, you can deal with your sick dog later, Boyle."
CHARLES," Well, actually, that was about my son, Nikolaj. He's got allergies. I think we may have to go with a nasal douche."
JAKE," Ah, nasal douche. Cool, cool, cool, cool. Very gross. Anyways, I'm back to being a cop. It's all I've thought about for the last six months."
CHARLES, Hurtful.
JAKE," But I won't be fully back until I've solved a case, just like old times. And I can't do that without my partner."
LOHANK," Pfft, you're not solving any cases on the night shift."
JAKE," Lohank? Oh, my God, you look-"
LOHANK, Beautiful?
JAKE," I was gonna say ""less sad""."
LOHANK," Ever since I moved to the day shift, I'm happier, healthier, my stepson gave me my debit card back."
JAKE," Lohank is happy and confident? Everything's off. Oh, no. We're in the Upside Down."
LOHANK, That's right. I'm gonna tell you the same thing they told me when they removed my testicle: Welcome to your new life.
JAKE," Nuh-uh, I'm not gonna let the night shift win. Me and my main man Boyle are about to solve a case. Isn't that right, Charles?"
CHARLES," Oh, you know we will. We'll call ourselves the Night Boys."
JAKE, Kind of sounds like a male escort service.
CHARLES, The Midnight Men.
JAKE, Even worse.
CHARLES, The Dark Stallions.
JAKE, Looks like we're going with the Night Boys.
CHARLES, Whoo!
AMY," I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but the night shift is taking all the fun out of paperwork."
ROSA, Mm-hmm.
AMY, At least we're getting to spend quality time together.
ROSA, Totally I'll be back in 40 minutes.
AMY, What? Where are you going? We have to finish this by morning.
ROSA," Yeah, I know. I just have something important I have to do."
AMY, What?
ROSA, I have to get some pens.
AMY, Then why are you putting your jacket on?
ROSA, Pen store's a block away.
AMY," The nearest pen store is seven blocks away, and it doesn't open until 9:00 a.m. I learned that the hard way. You really think you can lie to me?"
ROSA, No.
AMY, A-ha! You're lying to me right now. You do think you can lie to me.
ROSA, Yep.
AMY, Wait. Hang on. Was that a lie?
ROSA," I don't know, maybe. All right, see ya."
JAKE," Ah, our first case. Tasty little B&E just what the doctor ordered. Not actually, she recommended another week of bed rest. I was like, ""Whatever, dorkus"". Ah, check it out: Ducking under police tape. I missed this. Charles!"
CHARLES," Yep, yep, on it, on it, Jake-y."
JAKE, I got it.
CHARLES, Got it.
JAKE, What do we got?
OFFICER," Back window's broken, two sets of sneaker prints, alarm went off at 11:43, and security arrived at 11:46. Perps were already gone."
JAKE," Okay, I'm thinking classic us. I'm thinking old times. I'm thinking"
JAKE AND CHARLES, Rigity-rigity-role playas!
CHARLES," Yes, okay, I'm Jacques Guillaume, and you are Henri Renault. We are cat burglars on vacation from France."
JAKE," I love it although Henri went to an elite international school, so he does not speak with an accent."
CHARLES," Wow, nice, way to flesh out the characters."
JAKE," Thank you, okay, so I break the back window, make my way over to the jewelry case. Meanwhile, you're standing lookout by the front door -"
CHARLES," Oui, oui."
JAKE, Smoking a cigarette. Check it: Ash.
CHARLES," Ooh la la. Okay, so I am smoking."
JAKE, What are you doing?
CHARLES," Oh, Jacques rolls his own cigarettes, a habit he picked up from a prostitute in Marseille, but that is not all he picked up."
JAKE, Why do all your characters get STDs?
CHARLES, Because they're living life!
JAKE," All right, so I go to the first case smash steal a bunch of watches. Move over to the second case smash bracelets. But then, we hear a sound, and"
CHARLES," I yell, ""Les gendarmes! Ils sont ici!"""
JAKE," And I know what that means because I'm French, but I ask you to repeat it in English, just to be sure."
CHARLES, Police are here.
JAKE," Yes, we gotta get outta here, so we turn to leave, you flick your cigarette. Using the cane, using the cane, this is awesome. Voila! Zee butt."
CHARLES, I thought Henri didn't have an accent.
JAKE, It comes out when he gets excited.
JAKE," Great news, everyone. We just got our first lead on our first case on my first night back, proving once and for all that absolutely nothing has changed."
CHARLES," Yeah, this opens in instead of out now. They switched it a month ago."
JAKE," Yeah, so the door changed, sure, but that's it."
JAKE," Well, we have got ourselves a case and a key piece of evidence. We should be wrapping this thing up in no time."
CHARLES," As long as we do it before sunup. As soon as the shift is over, I kind of have to get home."
JAKE," But we're gonna work until it's done, right? I mean, that's how we do it."
CHARLES," Yeah, I just like to be home as soon as Nikolaj wakes up so I can make him breakfast."
JAKE," Sure, yeah, not a problem we'll be home by sunup. Just like a couple of sexy ""Twilight"" vampires. I am Robert Pattinson. I vant to turn into a bat. I've never seen the movies."
CHARLES," No, me neither they're an insult to the books."
JAKE," Okay. Crank up the tunes, Boyle. The Night Boys need an anthem. Something dark, something tough, something-"
CHARLES, I already got it.
JAKE, You know what? I'm into it. The night shift won't slow us down.
JAKE, Why is this going so slow? Where is everyone?
CHARLES," Well, it is 3:00 a.m. It's a pretty bare-bones crew."
LAB TECH," Hi, can I help you? Are you lost? Can I get you something coffee, tea?"
JAKE, You know what we're in a bit of a hurry. Can you run this DNA for us?
LAB TECH," Well, of course. Sorry, not many people stopping by at night. Sometimes it makes you like. Right?"
JAKE AND CHARLES, Uh-huh.
LAB TECH, I'll be back in a sec.
JAKE, Cool. Yikes not exactly the A-team at this hour.
LAB TECH," ""A-Team""? Are you guys talking ""A-Team""? I love that show I could download it. We should binge it. This is gonna be fun."
JAKE," Yep, totally excited to watch five full seasons of television with you, but could you actually run the DNA for us first?"
LAB TECH, It kind of feels like you're prioritizing work over our friendship.
JAKE, Because I barely know you?
LAB TECH," Fine, message received."
AMY," Oh, welcome back from your third massive break of the night."
ROSA, Thanks.
AMY, I was being sarcastic. Where do you keep going?
ROSA, Not saying.
AMY," Tell me, Diaz."
ROSA, Nope.
AMY," Come on, tell me."
ROSA, Not talking about it.
AMY," Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me"
ROSA, Fine. I was in the bathroom. I'm having stomach problems.
AMY," Oh, okay."
ROSA, Yeah.
AMY, Sorry.
ROSA, It's real bad
AMY," No, that's all right."
ROSA, You should've been there.
AMY, I don't have to hear it.
ROSA, It was like a massacre.
AMY," No, you can please stop."
ROSA, Multiple flush.
AMY, Please stop.
HOLT," Attention, squad. Everyone, gather 'round. I've been researching ways to raise morale, and I found an interesting article in a scientific journal."
TERRY," Oh, was it from ""The American Journal of No One Cares""?"
HOLT," According to a recent study, the physical act of smiling can improve your mood. I suggest we give it a shot. Eh? Now you all try. Big smiles, bigger, bigger! Great, now we just have to stay like this for the next two hours. Can you feel it working?"
SCULLY," I don't have any enamel on my teeth, so the cold air is excruciating."
TERRY," Maybe if you brushed your teeth once in a while, this wouldn't be a problem."
SCULLY, I do brush my teeth. They're decaying from acid reflux. You're embarrassing yourself.
GINA, Crikey.
AMY," You're not Australian, Gina."
GINA," Get stuffed, ya drongo."
SCULLY," Guys, seriously, too much exposure to air, and they will turn to dust."
HOLT, This isn't working out as well as I'd hoped. Time for the next level: Forced laughing.
CHARLES," Well, that lab tech took a long time."
JAKE," Once we agreed to go to his birthday party, he was actually pretty fast. But, most importantly, we got a DNA match. We're looking for Dave Smith. Sounds like a real piece of crap."
CHARLES, You said it. Now we just gotta pull his files from records.
JAKE," Yep, then we bust him, and we'll be done with plenty of time before Nikolaj wakes up."
CHARLES, Nikolaj.
JAKE," Hm? Nikolaj, yeah, I said it."
CHARLES, Nikolaj.
JAKE, Nikolaj.
CHARLES, Not even close. Nikolaj.
JAKE, Nikolaj.
JAKE, Nikolaj. I feel like I'm saying it. You know what it doesn't matter. Hit me with the music!
JAKE," Hi there, we just need to pull a file-"
RECEPTIONIST, Can't system's down. They do maintenance at night.
JAKE," That's okay, we'll just go to another precinct."
CHARLES, That's all.
JAKE, Yep.
CHARLES," Hi, can we get this file, please? We're in a bit of a hurry."
OLD RECEPTIONIST," Oh, absolutely, honey."
JAKE, She's going extremely slow.
CHARLES, She's going so slow.
JAKE, There we go.
OLD RECEPTIONIST," Oh, my glasses."
JAKE," All right, we'll just go to Five-Four."
JAKE," Hello, hi, please, file now, hurry."
JAKE," May I? Great, let me just get over oh, good lord, that is porn."
JAKE," It is not. No problem, we just close these tabs. You've got a lot of them."
SCULLY, Type 3 and type 9 and 12 and 13 those are all the diabeteses I have.
AMY, It's true what they say: Night shift makes for strange bedfellows.
HITCHCOCK," In your dreams, perv."
AMY, Ugh. Rosa? What the hell? She said she was in the bathroom again.
HITCHCOCK," Nah, she hasn't been to the bathroom since 8:27."
AMY," What? Also ew. C'mon, Hitchcock. Busted."
CHARLES," Man, this Dave Smith's bad news: Armed robbery, aggravated assault, attempted murder-"
JAKE," Well, he's about to get a visit from the Night Boys. Gah, this stupid limp is slowing me down. Charles, can you-"
CHARLES," Oh, give you a piggy?"
JAKE, What?
CHARLES," Yeah, jump on it I'll give you a piggy."
JAKE," Actually, I'm good. I was just gonna ask if you'd hold my bag."
CHARLES," Oh, yeah, sure, makes more sense."
JAKE, Yeah.
CHARLES, Embarrassed.
JAKE," Anyways, this is great. We're definitely gonna catch this guy before sunup, and you will be home to see your kid. Oh, no! Son of a bitch."
CHARLES," Jake, come on in. Nikolaj, look who it is. You remember Jake Peralta."
NIKOLAJ, From the stories.
CHARLES," Yeah, we talk about you at bedtime."
JAKE, Ah.
NIKOLAJ, Look at my cement truck.
CHARLES, He loves trucks.
JAKE," Cool, it's cool, buddy. Hey, listen, I know you're with your kid, but I checked the file, and our perp's last known address is like two blocks from here."
CHARLES, Really? We gotta go take him down.
JAKE," Yes, there's the Charles I know."
CHARLES," Tonight, Dave Smith goes down."
JAKE," Tonight? No, Charles, we gotta go now. You saw this guy's rap sheet he was arrested for attempted mur-"
CHARLES," Tickling, tickling attempted tickling."
JAKE," Right, tickling. Look, uh, Charles, this guy's a real doodyhead, all right? He tickled once he may tickle again. He might be tickling as we speak. We could be dealing with a serial tickler."
CHARLES," I really want to go, Jake, but I'm here alone with Nikolaj. Genevieve doesn't get back for three hours."
JAKE," So let's just take him with us. Nah, that's crazy or is it just crazy enough to work? Just crazy. Ah, man, it stinks you've gotta watch him it's really messing everything up. I mean, that came out wrong. I love that you have a son it's not messing everything up. Just messing up our ability to solve the case and have fun. Ah, you know what I mean. I'm a nice guy I'm in the right. I'll just go myself. Bye, Nikolaj."
NIKOLAJ, Nikolaj.
JAKE," Yeah, whatever. See ya."
HOLT," I know your shift is over, and you've had a challenging night, but I think I've found a new way to raise morale. Follow me to the briefing room."
ROSA, What's all this?
HOLT," It's an after-work hang. Just trying to turn up, as it were. We got snacks, games, decorations, chairs-"
SCULLY," Yes, chairs."
AMY," Cool, maybe we can mill around and small talk about how some of us are big lying liars who lie all the time like a bunch of liars, Rosa."
HOLT," I don't think that's good party convo. Uh, maybe we should just name our favorite sailing knot. I'll start. The bowline. How about some tunes?"
ROSA," Cool, merry-go-round music."
HOLT," Yeah, John Phillips Sousa, the Skrillex of his day. C'mon, people, hit the dance floor. Have a good time. Why is no one having a good time? I specifically requested it. Gina, why aren't you dancing?"
GINA," I can't. I'm in the middle of a feud with the ""that's not a knife"" guy from ""Crocodile Dundee"". He's being a real bitch."
HOLT," Fine, I guess I'll just stop the party."
TERRY, I didn't realize it ever started.
HOLT," Enough. I tried to make this fun. I even learned what Skrillex was. Sorry you're all miserable, but guess what? So am I. I'm exhausted all the time, I never see my husband, the late-night NPR programming pure garbage. I'm done trying. We can all be miserable together. Just go home."
AMY," Hey, I saw you earlier. You weren't in the bathroom. You were on a park bench playing on your phone. Yeah, you left me to do everything while I thought you were pooping. I wish you were pooping. I wish to God."
ROSA, I'm sorry.
AMY," Oh, Rosa, crying, don't know what to do. Pat, pat. This feels wrong."
ROSA," We put away Figgis three weeks ago. Pimento should've been back by now. We had plans to meet on that park bench once the coast was clear, but he hasn't shown up."
AMY," Maybe he's deep undercover, or he doesn't remember who he is, or maybe he's dead."
ROSA," Wow, thanks. You're right, my fiancé's a total weirdo who's probably dead. I'll just give up on him and go do my paperwork."
AMY," No, Diaz, wait maybe he's just really, really injured. Come on, Amy."
JAKE," All right, Fiske, Jones, Thompkins- Smith. Smith. Whoa, hey, NYPD, freeze! Slow down! This isn't fair! I have a cane. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. NYPD. NYPD. I need to commandeer this vehicle."
JESSICA," It's a crossover. It's a crossover SUV, and you can't have it."
JAKE, I'm a cop can you please get out of the car?
JESSICA," No, this Schmidt's mom's car, and I'm more scared of her than I am of some two-bit thug."
JAKE, I'm not a thug I'm police.
JESSICA," Okay, then name one law."
JAKE, Don't kill people.
JESSICA, That's on me I set the bar too low.
JAKE," Look, can you please just get out?"
JESSICA," Okay, you can drive, but I'm not getting out."
JAKE, Right.
JESSICA," Also, I have the seat warmer on I don't just have a really hot butt."
JAKE," Doesn't matter to me, a perp is getting away. Oh, it's very hot."
JESSICA," I can't believe this is happening. Thanks a lot, New York. You know what, if your city's so great, then how come it's not the state capital?"
JAKE, What who cares about the state's capital? This is the concrete jungle where dreams are made of. That doesn't sound right where dreams are made of?
JESSICA, I don't know you tell me. It's your dumb city.
JAKE," It's grammatically odd. Whatever, I'm sure wherever you're from has strange songs written about it, too."
JESSICA, Los Angeles?
JAKE," Damn it, all the songs there are so good."
JESSICA," Hey, watch my soup."
JAKE, I'm chasing a criminal. Your soup is not important.
JESSICA, You took an oath to serve and protect. That applies to my soup.
JAKE, You know that's not what the oath is about. You're making a point you don't even believe in.
JESSICA, Garbage truck! Oh.
JAKE, Damn it! He got away.
JESSICA," Well, I spilled my soup. You tell me which is worse."
JAKE, My thing. Very clearly my thing.
TERRY," Captain Holt, can we talk to you?"
HOLT, What is the meaning of this? Am I the subject of a punking?
TERRY, It's a beginning-of-work hang.
HOLT, And why are you all in such good moods?
AMY," Because you told us that you're miserable, too. And that means you'll fight to get us off the night shift, right?"
HOLT," Well, here's what I have to say about that: The night shift stinks, stinks like a butt. And I will do everything in my power to make sure we get back to the day shift. What are we standing around for? Put some Sousa on already. I want to get wild."
LOHANK," Well, well, well, if it isn't one of the world-famous Night Bros."
JAKE," It's the Night Boys, and why did I correct you? I would've preferred ""Bros."""
LOHANK, Did you solve your case yet?
JAKE, No.
LOHANK," Night shift, am I right? You remind me of me."
JAKE," It's not the night shift, okay? I found the perp, and I would've taken him down, but I'm hobbled, and I didn't have a partner because ever since Boyle had a son, that's all he can focus on."
LOHANK," Whoa, hey, are you angry at Boyle for having a kid?"
JAKE," No, I'm just mad because I'm working the night shift, and I have to use a cane, and, yes, the one thing I could always count on no matter what Boyle being there for me is also gone."
LOHANK, What do you say we let day shift Lohank take a crack at this? I'm gonna put a little something up in the old hopper. You tell me if it vibes with you.
JAKE, That's so gross.
LOHANK," Life moves forwards, not backwards, and things will never be as they were. And you can be angry about that, or you can embrace the fact that your best friend now has a son. How cool is that, amigo?"
JAKE," Ugh, ""amigo"". All right, fine, yes, I'll admit it, it is pretty cool. Boyle's wanted it for a very long time. I guess I haven't actually spent that much time with Nikolaj yet."
LOHANK, Nikolaj.
JAKE," Man, am I seriously about to take emotional advice from Lohank?"
LOHANK," You know you want to, compadre. Go to him."
AMY," Hey, I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have said that about Pimento. I'm sure he's gonna come back."
ROSA," I'm not even thinking about it anymore. That wasn't even me crying in the bathroom earlier that was someone else with these same boots, but now she's gone."
AMY," Look, when Jake was in witness protection, and I didn't know when he was ever coming back, you were always there when I needed to vent. So, I'll do your paperwork, and if you ever want company on that bench, I'm there."
ROSA," Thanks I would advise against it though if he does come back, things are gonna get real raunchy, real fast, like, do a lot of licking, that's probably indecent exposure. I don't want to get-"
AMY," Okay, got it. You know what I'll just start with this stack right here. Thanks, Rosa, okay, good talk."
CHARLES," Hey, what's up? I can't work the case tonight. Nikolaj's allergies are acting up, and now the dog seems to be allergic to him. It's this whole thing. Did you find Smith?"
JAKE," No, uh, he actually got away."
CHARLES," Sorry, man."
JAKE," Ah, it's all right. It's the day shift's problem now."
CHARLES, Whatever happened to working until it's done?
JAKE, Honestly Lohank kind of talked some sense into me.
CHARLES, Lohank?
JAKE," Yeah, it was so gross, but I want to apologize."
CHARLES," For what? Well, I kept talking about how I wanted everything to go back to normal, but if that actually happened, this little guy wouldn't be here. Or is he big? I don't know what size kids are supposed to be, or anything about kids, really. I think maybe that's part of the problem it doesn't matter. I got a present for Nikolaj."
CHARLES," Thanks, Jake. Come on in, give it to him. Niko."
JAKE," Hey, little man."
NIKOLAJ, A garbage truck!
JAKE," You wanna know something cool? A truck just like this almost killed me today. Uh, kissed me, almost kissed me. Anyway, let's get some trash in this thing am I right?"
NIKOLAJ, You're silly.
JAKE, Yeah. I am silly.
CHARLES," Oh, my God, this is a dream come true. I gotta get my phone I gotta film this. Oh, but then I'll miss it. Oh, but I want it forever. Agh, but I should stay in the moment. Ah, but then I'll forget. Oh, my God, this is a nightmare."
AMY," Attention, squad."
GINA," Mm, pretty dainty way to make an announcement."
AMY, It's a workplace. I wanted to be respectful.
SCULLY," Well, as someone at a high risk for a spook-related death, thank you."
AMY," As I was saying, it's time for round four of the Halloween Heist"
SCULLY," If I don't make it, tell Gina I love her."
JAKE," What's up, Nine-Nine? Jake Peralta here to tell you that tonight is the night for the Halloween-"
TERRY, Heist. Amy already went over this.
JAKE," What? Ames, what are you doing? I always announce the heist."
CHARLES," Yeah, Amy, what the hell are you doing?"
AMY, Exercising my right to announce the heist as the defending champion.
JAKE, Defending champion. The only reason you won is 'cause no one knew you were even playing. It was a pathetic act of pure cowardice.
TERRY," Whoa, she's your girlfriend, Peralta."
JAKE," Not tonight, she isn't. Although don't kiss anyone else. I love you so much. Now, then, this one's for all-"
JAKE, Such a dork.
AMY, So cool.
HOLT," Attention, squad. Tonight-"
TERRY, Nope.
TERRY, Y'all three really should have coordinated.
HOLT," What? I really should be the one to introduce the heist, as the last legitimate champion. Peralta hasn't won since the first year. He's a has-been."
JAKE," Yeah, well, this has-been has been with yo' mama all week. Sorry, I feel like I crossed a line; I apologize."
HITCHCOCK," Attention, everyone."
ROSA, Enough. We know. The heist is happening.
HITCHCOCK," No! My ex-wife just died. No more alimony, baby!"
JAKE," This year's Halloween Heist is a three-way tiebreaker to determine the champion of champions. We'll be playing for this: a plaque that reads, ""The Ultimate Detective/Genius""."
HOLT, You and Santiago should quit now. I'm going to stomp on your dreams.
AMY, It's fun to see you so passionate.
HOLT, I will slit you both open from mouth to anus and wear you like jackets.
JAKE, Huh. Is it weird that that turned me on a little bit? Doesn't matter. But let's move on. The plaque will be held in this.
AMY, Is that my childhood caboodle?
JAKE," It most certainly is, but don't worry. I removed the scrunchies, old report cards, and photos of young Al Gore. I'm better-looking than him anyway."
HOLT," We're talking a young Al Gore? Peralta, you do make me laugh."
JAKE," Okay, stings a little bit. It will be secured with this brand-new lock. Hitchcock, if you would do the honors. There you are."
HITCHCOCK, You can have that back in three-
JAKE," Nope, don't ever need it back. Now, then, locking the caboodle."
HOLT," The ""ca-boo-dale"" will be placed in the center of the bullpen."
JAKE," Right, and what is the name of the store at the mall that sells the sticky pastries?"
HOLT," You mean the ""See-nay-bone""?"
JAKE," Yeah, that was it. Thanks. Continue."
HOLT, Whoever possesses the plaque at sunup wins. Now let's pick teams.
TERRY, I've got a ton of work. You can just leave me out this year.
JAKE, Interesting. Interesting.
AMY," Oh, Terry, Terry, Terry."
TERRY, What?
HOLT," How naive do you think we are? You're ""not participating"" so you can sneak under our noses and steal a victory, like Santiago did last year."
TERRY, I'm going to my desk. Heists are dumb.
JAKE," If you have nothing to hide, then I'm sure you won't mind me asking Hitchcock and Scully to keep an eye on you."
TERRY, Whatever.
HITCHCOCK, My eyes will be glued to that ass.
JAKE," Great! It's now time to choose from the remaining players. Amy, since you're last year's champion, you go first."
AMY, I choose Rosa.
ROSA, Dope.
HOLT, I select Charles Boyle.
JAKE, What?
HOLT," What's the matter, Peralta? Were you expecting to have Detective Boyle on your team? Have I thrown a wrench into your plans?"
JAKE," Absolutely not. I'm just surprised, because you have such a strong connection with Gina. But I'm glad she's on my team. I had absolutely nothing planned for Charles."
JAKE, I totally planned everything for Charles. This is a nightmare!
GINA, Ew! What can Charles Boyle do that I can't?
JAKE, Roller-skate like an angel.
GINA," Whore, I'm great on skates. Or are you forgetting Jenn Sutton's fourth grade birthday party?"
JAKE, I have definitely forgotten that.
GINA," Well, I skated like a pro, and then I spent seven minutes in heaven with the Todd Cohen. It was dope. My point is, I can do anything Charles can."
JAKE," Except look exactly like the body double I got for him. Bill, you can come out now."
BILL, Hi.
GINA," Okay, yeah, this pasty white guy is gonna be a problem."
AMY,So I believe the key to good teamwork is an equal exchange of ideas-
ROSA," Stop. I know you already have a plan. And I want to win, so for the next eight hours, I'm down with all your nerdy crap. Come on, Amy. Show me the binder."
AMY," Okay, but it's not a binder. It's a virtual binder, and it's encrypted on this flash drive."
ROSA," That's my girl. Now, where's the 3-D model of the precinct?"
AMY, Inside the key chain. It's a frickin' hologram.
ROSA, Yes.
CHARLES," I'm so excited, Captain. So, how are we gonna do it?"
HOLT, Here's everything you need to know.
CHARLES, It's blank.
HOLT," It's a metaphor. You get nothing. You lose. Good day, sir."
CHARLES, But we're teammates. You chose me.
HOLT," You're too close with Peralta. I don't trust you. I only chose you to disrupt his plans. And now that you've served your purpose, you're no longer needed."
CHARLES, I feel so used. Am I just a piece of meat to you?
HOLT," Yes. Now, put on a smile, Pork Chop."
SCULLY, So what are you planning for the heist?
TERRY, The only thing I'm planning is getting my work done.
HITCHCOCK," Sure, you are. Come clean, or we'll tell everybody about your mistress."
TERRY, I don't have a mistress.
HITCHCOCK, You don't? But you're so good-looking. What's the point?
JAKE," As expected, all eyes are on the caboodle. It's go time. Now, Gina."
GINA," Whoopsie! Bill, but you got to stand like me. I'm kind of like a young Brando, so give it that energy. Okay, yeah. You're doing the best you can with the tools that you have."
JAKE," Looks like nobody's onto us. Go, Gina! So, Bill, do you have a real job or-"
BILL," I'm the third in a lot of marriages. I got a nice soft face, so I don't intimidate the husbands."
JAKE," Hmm, strange, the random person I hired off the streets of Brooklyn is a weirdo."
BILL, What?
JAKE," Hmm? Nothing. There she goes. Now, Bill, the key here is that I came in before work and replaced the door handles with ones that lock from the outside. Pretty smart. All right, Bill. The time is now. Show your face. Show your face to the world!"
ROSA, What the hell? Amy!
GINA," Pick your jaws up off the floor, ladies."
HOLT, Where did Gina come from?
JAKE," And here comes Jake! Whoo! Welcome to the big show. I was gonna sneak the plaque out without anybody knowing, but then I thought so much more fun to make you watch. Now enjoy as I steal the plaque of destiny. Ah, trying to pick the lock, El Capitán? That'll take at least three minutes, by which time I will have hidden this plaque somewhere you will never find it. Voilà. Of course, you could break the window, but you would never knowingly destroy government property, would you? Whoop! Well, misread that one."
HOLT, Aah!
GINA," So long, suckers!"
JAKE," Oh! Gina, are you okay?"
GINA, It's cool. I'm fine. Ain't no thang.
JAKE," Totally, girl! You look good!"
GINA," Oh, it hurts so bad. I hope to God I'm not humbled by this."
JAKE," I'm so sorry, Gina. It should have been Charles on those skates."
CHARLES, This is why you should always roller-skate with a helmet and a mouth guard.
ROSA," Hey, don't blame the victim."
CHARLES, I'm just so sick of roller skating's dangerous image. We're not all bad boys.
JAKE," Yeah, none. All right, Gina, get your stuff. I'm taking you to the dentist."
GINA," No, no, no, no. I'll go alone. I don't need anyone's help. Just order me an Uber SELECT or better."
HOLT," And despite our natural desire to stop everything, you'd like us to soldier on in your absence and keep the heist going?"
GINA," Yeah, that's fine."
HOLT," Well, you heard the lady. She insists we continue. Let's mop up this blood and get back at it."
AMY," With all due respect, sir, I don't think that's the best idea. The blood is dry. We can just clean it up after."
HOLT," Oh, agreed."
JAKE," Ah, I love tonight. However, there is the small issue of me losing my partner. Now, Terry, I know that you were upset that no one picked you earlier."
TERRY, Not what happened.
JAKE," Regardless, please be my partner, please, please, please, please, please, please."
TERRY," No! Heists are dumb, and I have work to do."
JAKE," You're dumb, and I have heist to do. Overreacted. Damn it! You know what? Forget Terry. At the time of the accident, my team had the plaque, so I will just grab it and give myself a four-minute head start."
HOLT," Not so fast, Peralta. I say we reset the plaque and start over."
JAKE," What? But my team had it. Charles, tell him."
CHARLES," No, Jake. We're resetting."
JAKE," Charles, what are you saying?"
CHARLES, The plaque goes back!
HOLT," Yes, Pork Chop. Yes."
ROSA," I have eyes on Kristy, Stacey, and Claudia."
AMY," You used their code names. You read the plans, addenda and all!"
ROSA," Damn right, I did. I told you, I'm all in."
AMY," And you didn't make fun of me for basing it all on ""The Baby-Sitters Club""."
ROSA," And I even did your suggested reading of ""Kristy's Big Day""."
AMY, You did?
ROSA, Calm down. You're such a Mary Anne.
AMY, I am! It's true!
HOLT," So, Boyle, I was impressed with how you stood up to Peralta and demanded a reset."
CHARLES," Ha! I'm Team Holt all the way, baby. Also, I'm pretty upset with him for letting Gina sweat up my skates."
HOLT," Well, perhaps I can use a teammate after all. Do you swear I can trust you?"
CHARLES, Yes. I swear.
HOLT, Let's unleash hell.
JAKE," Thanks for coming back, Bill. I really needed a teammate."
BILL," Hey, man, you're paying."
JAKE, Yeah. You can take the wig off if you want.
BILL," Whatever you want, man. You're paying."
JAKE," Could you stop saying that, Bill? It's making me a little uncomfortable."
BILL," All right, man. It's your money. That's the same thing."
SCULLY, What is this?
TERRY, It's a jack-o'-lantern. Don't touch it.
HITCHCOCK, Why not? Because you're hiding something in there?
TERRY, Because my daughters made it and your palms are all black. What have you been touching?
HITCHCOCK," Huh! Well, this has got me stumped."
PIZZA DELIVERY MAN, I got a pizza here for Raymond Holt.
JAKE," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Holt hates pizza. He's trying to distract us."
HOLT," Oh, if I were trying to distract you, I would have sent you the pizza. This is your doing, you and your male prostitute."
JAKE," Bill is not a male prostitute, I don't think."
AMY, What's going on?
AMY, Which one of you bozos did this?
JAKE, Us? You know how much planning it takes to get this many pizza guys here at the same time? A binder full of planning. This has Amy written all over it.
AMY," If I had done this, it would say ""Captain Raymond Holt"". I'm not going to disrespect you, sir, even for the sake of the heist."
HOLT, I'll guard the plaque!
AMY, You're not leaving my sight.
JAKE," Bill, can you see what's going on? Do you have eyes on Charles and Rosa?"
BILL, I don't know who anybody is.
CHARLES, There's too much pizza!
ROSA, I see Holt. I see Charles. Where's Terry?
TERRY," Terry's leaving, because Terry's got work to do."
JAKE, Hitchcock! Scully! Follow Terry!
SCULLY AND HITCHCOCK, On it!
JAKE, Aah! I'm getting bounced around like a pinball!
AMY, This is madness!
HOLT," Who hired you? Who do you work for, pizza man?"
JAKE," Everyone with a pizza, get out of here! The caboodle!"
AMY, The caboodle!
HOLT," The ""ca-boo-dale""!"
JAKE," I know one of you took the plaque. And I swear on my living mother's future grave, I'm not gonna let you get away with it."
CHARLES," Or it was you, Jake. You love pizza."
AMY, It's true. You had it for breakfast this morning.
JAKE," When pizza's on a bagel, you can eat pizza anytime!"
HOLT," Well, it certainly wasn't Boyle and me. We were out here the whole time."
CHARLES," Plus, we already ate. Autumn salads with farm-fresh squash. That's right, I'm catering for our team."
ROSA,Look who I found hiding in the interrogation room: this guilty son of a bitch.
TERRY," Still your sergeant. Look, I wasn't hiding. I was doing my work. Hitchcock and Scully were with me."
JAKE," Were they, or perhaps were they distracted by your brilliant pizza ruse?"
SCULLY, Totally distracted. I ate two whole pies. Folded 'em up like tacos.
AMY," You're suspect number one, Jeffords."
TERRY, Whatever.
HOLT," ""Whatever"". Spoken like a common criminal."
AMY," Still a long time till sunup. All I have to say is, whoever took that plaque, you better watch out. Come on, Rosa."
HOLT," Come on, Boyle."
CHARLES," Yes, sir."
JAKE, Come on Bill.
AMY," Okay, was the operation a success?"
ROSA, You tell me. Blended right in with the pizza guys. Got out my bolt cutters. Lock snapped on the first try. No one saw me leave. Got to hand it to you beautiful plan.
AMY, Beautiful execution.
ROSA, It's kind of like we're our own baby-sitters club.
AMY," Oh, my God, I don't want tonight to ever end. Did you by chance read the excerpt from ""The Truth About Stacey""?"
ROSA, The one about the rival baby-sitters-
AMY," That get caught smoking cigarettes? Well, let's just say that these two baby-sitters aren't getting caught with squat. This is where I stash a few cigarettes on the rare occasion that I need a puff."
ROSA," Dope. The hiding place, not the smoking. Mary Anne is better than that."
AMY, She's a work in progress.
CHARLES, This is so frustrating. There's no way of knowing who has the plaque.
HOLT, Amy and Rosa have it.
CHARLES, What? How do you know?
HOLT," Diaz usually favors her left leg, but after ""zero dark pizza"", she was suddenly favoring her right."
CHARLES," Yes, yes, which means that she was..."
HOLT, You trailed off and didn't finish speaking. Continue.
CHARLES, I don't want to.
HOLT, Her gait was thrown off because she was carrying the plaque. And I know exactly where it's hidden: in Santiago's secret cigarette stash.
CHARLES, How did you find that?
HOLT," Whenever she gets stressed out, she smokes. And it's almost too easy to stress her out."
HOLT," Oh, Santiago, I Never mind."
AMY, What is it? What? I got to go.
HOLT, Bing-pot.
HOLT, And now it's time to send in our cute little secret weapon.
CHARLES," I'm ready, Captain. I love the nickname."
HOLT," No, Charles, not you. I was talking about Cheddar."
CHARLES," Oh, right, obviously."
HOLT," Over the past month, I've had him trained to retrieve plaques. And now, boy, it's time to make Daddy proud."
CHARLES," Yes, sir."
HOLT, I could not have been more clearly talking to the dog.
JAKE," Time is running out. We got to stop playing by the rules and start playing dirty. Follow my lead, Bill."
BILL," Okay, but first I should tell you my safe word is ""cabbage""."
JAKE," Why? You know what? Never mind. It doesn't matter. Hey, Charles! Charles, get in here. Come on. What is Holt up to? Does he have the plaque? Does he know who does?"
CHARLES," I'm not telling you that, Jake. I'm Team Holt, and there's nothing you could say that will change that."
JAKE," Okay, fine, then I guess I have a new best friend, and his name is Bill."
CHARLES, You're not serious. He's just a prop for the heist.
JAKE," Sure, it started out that way, but you know how these things go, spending time together, sharing intimate secrets, laughing about nothing in particular."
BILL, Cabbage.
CHARLES," Holt has the plaque. It's hidden in the evidence room in a box marked ""Cold Cases 1972""."
JAKE," Thanks, bud. We will always be best friends."
CHARLES," You hear that, Bill? Nobody likes you!"
JAKE, Ain't she a beaut?
BILL, Sexy.
JAKE," Immediately ruined it, Bill. Immediately."
JAKE, Here you go.
HOLT," Chht, chht, chht, chh."
JAKE, What is happening right now?
HOLT," The last sands are running through the hourglass. Chh, chh, chh. Because your time is running out, and you are never going to get the plaque."
CHARLES," Oh, Captain, stop. I just can't let you embarrass yourself. I told Jake everything. He threatened to replace me, and I freaked out hard. I'm sorry."
HOLT, It's okay. I knew you would betray me. That's why I fed you fake Intel.
JAKE AND CHARLES, What?
HOLT," The plaque was never in ""Cold Cases 1972"". As if I'd just put it in a box, unattended."
JAKE," Uh, but you did."
HOLT," No, I didn't."
JAKE, Then how do you explain this?
HOLT," I have no idea. I put the plaque in my office. Cheddar? Come here. Come here. Come here, baby."
JAKE, What the hell?
HOLT," Yeah, thank you. Return to my office, please."
ROSA," What's up, you little turds? Wait, what is going on? We have the plaque."
AMY," Yeah, I just got it out of the vent to rub it in your faces."
JAKE," ""I Just Got It Out of the Vent to Rub It in Your Faces""; name of your sex tape. What?"
HOLT, Something strange is afoot. Which of these is real?
ROSA, Black lights. What the hell?
AMY," Oh, my God. Our precinct is disgusting."
CHARLES, Dear God. Hitchcock and Scully's desk.
ALL, Ugh!
JAKE, Wait. Look at the plaques.
JAKE," ""Are""."
CHARLES," ""Heists""."
JAKE," ""Dumb"". Are heists dumb? Of course not. That was a stupid question."
AMY," No, Jake, it's says, ""Heists are dumb""."
ALL, Terry!
JAKE, The Oscar for best liar goes to you!
TERRY, That's not an Oscars category. What's going on?
AMY," Not to be harsh, Sarge, but you're setting a terrible example for your daughters, and they're gonna grow up to be total failures."
TERRY, You take that back.
HOLT," No, she's right, Jeffords. Your children are doomed. Where's the plaque?"
TERRY," For the last time, I don't know. I've been working here the whole time. Ask them."
SCULLY," Well, actually, we both fell asleep."
HITCHCOCK, And Jeffords never woke us up. Coincidence?
TERRY, I don't need this.
ROSA, You're not going anywhere.
TERRY," Damn, Rosa!"
CHARLES, He's trying to get away! Everyone start panicking!
ROSA, He had someone lock the door.
GINA," 'Sup, losers? I have the real plaque! Unh, unh!"
JAKE," Gina! Of course! It all makes sense, except for the parts I don't understand and the fact that I still kind of think Terry did this."
GINA," Nope, it was all me. Three weeks ago, Captain Holt asked me to order a plaque that read, ""The Ultimate Detective/Genius""."
GINA," I did it, and I ordered three copies and a statue of Tyrese riding a dolphin."
ROSA, Is that relevant?
GINA," To my life, yes. Once I had the plaques, I manipulated Captain Holt into choosing Boyle as his partner. All it took was six bottles of dish soap."
GINA," See, this is what happens when Jake tries to wash dishes by himself. It's like he's helpless without Boyle."
HOLT, Yes. He is helpless without Boyle.
GINA, And you fell for my trap like a greedy little rat.
HOLT, Easy.
GINA," Yes, it was easy. And the next phase of my plan."
GINA," A, quote unquote, ""skating accident""."
JAKE, But you knocked out your two front teeth.
GINA, False teeth.
GINA, Fake blood. I lost my real teeth at Jenn Sutton's birthday party in fourth grade.
JAKE," Oh, you made sure I didn't remember that!"
GINA, It was minute five of seven minutes in heaven with Todd Cohen when he bumped the wall and a bowling ball fell on my face.
JAKE, Maybe I just wasn't at that party.
GINA," Once I had faked the skating mishap, I swapped out a dummy plaque for the real one. Then I left to go to the dentist."
CHARLES, And you convinced your dentist to help you carry out the rest of the heist.
GINA, No.
CHARLES, Of course not. Go ahead.
GINA," I came back, wearing the perfect disguise to make sure I was never noticed by anyone. Something so drab and uninspiring-"
AMY, This feels like it's gonna be a dig on me.
GINA, I wore Amy's clothes.
AMY, There it is.
HOLT," This is your doing, you and your male prostitute."
JAKE," Bill is not a male prostitute, I don't think."
AMY, That suit is not drab. It has a fun salmon lining.
GINA," No, Amy, it made me invisible. And now that I had that power."
GINA, Every time one of you stole a plaque. I replaced it with a fake.
GINA, And no one had any idea.
GINA," ""Heists are dumb""."
JAKE," Then we raced in here to blame Terry, and you trapped us. But how did you know he was gonna say ""heists are dumb""?"
GINA, Terry says that about everything.
TERRY, Everyone should wear suspenders. Belts are dumb.
TERRY, People should swim forward. The backstroke is dumb.
TERRY, 30 grams of fat? Hummus is dumb.
GINA," And now here you all are, locked up behind the glass like a bunch of loser fish. I bet you're wondering why I did it."
AMY, Because you wanted to win?
GINA, No! I had a loftier goal in mind. Can you do me a favor and tell me what that says right there?
HOLT," ""The Ultimate Detective/Genius""."
GINA, Detective. Can you imagine what that word sounds like to someone who's not a detective? Discriminatory. It's worse than segregation.
TERRY AND HOLT, Uh-uh.
GINA," Too far? I'm sorry. But I think I've proved a point, and that's why we're changing the name of the plaque forever!"
HOLT, To what?
ALL, Gina Linetti is the ultimate human/genius.
GINA, Thank you. And now I'd like to say a few words.
ROSA," You talked for, like, an hour when you had us locked in that interrogation room."
GINA," I'm a fair ruler. Your comment has been heard. But seriously, you guys, I just want to say, I freaking love you losers. Happy Halloween."
ALL, Happy Halloween!
ROSA, Take out your teeth.
TERRY, Yeah!
CHARLES, Yeah!
ALL, Take out your teeth! Take out your teeth! Take out your teeth! Oh!
GINA, I'm invincible!
NIKOLAJ," Papa, Papa, come in here!"
CHARLES," Hey, Papa’s here. (He sits down on the end of the bed)"
NIKOLAJ," Papa, I'm so scared. There's a monster in my closet."
CHARLES," Oh, buddy. Shh. It's okay, I'm here. Monster's aren't real, my little pierogi."
NIKOLAJ, But I saw it. It was big and hairy.
CHARLES," You just had a nightmare, buddy."
NIKOLAJ," No, it was real!"
CHARLES," I'm sure it felt that way. But (he stands up and walks over to the closet) I am gonna open this closet, and I’m gonna show you that there’s nothing in there."
NIKOLAJ," Don't do that, Papa!"
CHARLES, See? (He pulls open the closet and we see Adrian Pimento standing in there) Nothing-
CHARLES, Whoo!
PIMENTO," Ah, hey, Chuck. It’s Pimento."
CHARLES," And now Nikolaj says he's too frightened to ever sleep again, so that's just superduper."
PIMENTO," I don’t understand what he's so scared about. If I was there to kill him, he never would've heard me."
CHARLES, A thing you told him several times.
JAKE," God, Nikolaj is having such a rich childhood."
TERRY, Can we back up? (He turns to Pimento) What were you doing in Boyle's closet in the first place?
PIMENTO," Well, I still had a key from when I was crashing there last year, and I wanted to shower and anoint my body with essential oils before I saw Rosa. Duh."
JAKE," Well, she's gonna be so psyched that you're back."
GINA, Where have you been all this time? Figgis has been locked up for a month.
PIMENTO, I was in prison in Uzbekistan. It's actually not as bad as it sounds.
PIMENTO, I deserve this!
AKE, Why were you in jail?
PIMENTO," Ah, I got shot down smuggling ammo to a rebel group, flying an old Soviet prop plane. They tortured us. Made me eat my co-pilot's tongue. Oof, now I've got a taste for it."
HOLT, The important thing is you're safe and sound and back in Brooklyn.
PIMENTO," Thank you, Captain. Ooh, you smell good! Wowza."
HOLT, And end of hug.
PIMENTO, (He pulls away) Okay.
HOLT, I'll see about getting you reinstated to the NYPD immediately.
GINA, I think this deserves another hug.
PIMENTO, Me too.
HOLT, Nope. One was sufficient.
PIMENTO, Cool.
ROSA," Pimento, you son of a bitch!"
PIMENTO, You're the son of a bitch!
ROSA," Oh, we'll see who's a son of a bitch. (She walks over to him quickly)"
PIMENTO," Oh, yes, we will."
AMY, Aww. It's so sweet.
AMY, And violent.
JAKE," Yeah, this is awkward. I'm sure they'll stop soon."
JAKE, And it's escalating. Let's go.
TERRY, I left my phone in the briefing room.
TERRY, It's been 20 minutes. You think they're still-
HITCHCOCK," (He turns to them) They're not doing anything. Kissing just turned into talk. It's like, why even work here?"
ROSA, Listen up! We have an announcement to make.
PIMENTO," When I was in that Uzbek prison, choking on my own blood because my face was being beaten in, I realized, life is funny!"
TERRY, That's what you realized?
PIMENTO, Mm-hmm.
ROSA, And it's short. We're picking up where we left off when Adrian went into hiding. We're getting married tomorrow.
TERRY, Tomorrow. That's real quick.
PIMENTO," Thank you, Sarge."
PIMENTO," And we want it to be beautiful, and lush, and romantic, just like a Nancy Meyers movie."
ROSA, She's our favorite director.
JAKE," Aw. I love ""You've Got Mail""."
ROSA," That's Nora Ephron, you idiot."
JAKE, I know.
AMY," Wait, hold up. Planning a wedding like that in 14 hours would be the greatest organizational challenge in history. How are you gonna do it?"
ROSA, I was kinda hoping you would. (She smiles)
AMY, I thought I was supposed to get you guys the wedding present! (She laughs and claps) Of course I will!
ROSA, That's my girl.
AMY," (She cheerfully sighs and walks towards Rosa and Pimento before turning around to address the rest of the squad) All right. Listen up, people. The next 14 hours are gonna be hell, but in the end you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you've finally done something worthwhile with your lives."
TERRY, I kinda think the police work we do-
AMY," Eh-eh-eh! (Amy raises her voice) I don't have time to stroke your damn ego, Sergeant. Let's make a wedding!"
PIMENTO," Hey, Jake."
PIMENTO, I need a wedding favor.
JAKE," Of course. Anything. Except killing someone, or maiming someone, or breaking the law in any way, or nudity. Also I don't like waking up super early in the morning you know what, why don't you just tell me what you want?"
PIMENTO," Cool, I need to go to Neustadter, New York. I gotta pick up a pair of ruby earrings I pawned before I went into hiding."
JAKE, Neustadter's like six hours away. I'm not so sure we can get there and back in time.
PIMENTO," Jake, there's no wedding without the earrings. My grandmother wore them on her wedding day, and said they blessed her union. Do you want this union to be blessed, Jake? Or do you want this union to be friggin' unblessed?"
JAKE," Blessed, totally blessed. I'll do it, it's fine. But I should warn you, my car is a piece of junk and it's always breaking down."
PIMENTO," Ah, come on! The universe isn't gonna let anything bad happen to two best friends (He suddenly turns serious) unless we're in a fiery crash, and our bodies are burned beyond recognition."
PIMENTO," Ooh, Gina's got jelly beans!"
GINA," Pimento, no."
GINA, Bad.
PIMENTO," Sorry, Gina. (He turns to Jake, murmurs and then walks off)"
JAKE," Turning to Gina That was amazing. He actually listens to you. Hey, you should come with us on this trip. You know, in case he starts acting-"
GINA, Bat crap loony tunes.
JAKE, Yes. You can use your powers to keep him in check.
GINA," Yeah, people fear me."
JAKE, Mm.
GINA, The only reason I'm not your boss right now is 'cause I'd hate to do that to Holt. He needs this.
JAKE, And also you're not a cop.
GINA," Well, you're not the basis of a character on ""Empire"", Jake, but I don't throw that in your face every damn day."
JAKE, So you will come with us?
GINA," Yeah, I'll be there."
JAKE, Pointing at Gina You da man!
GINA," Bye, girl!"
JAKE," See ya in the car, girl."
AMY," Okay. First, the good news. I've generated a detailed timeline broken down into 30-second increments to keep us on track. The bad news: we're already 16.5 increments behind schedule."
TERRY," Oh, man. Terry feels overwhelmed."
AMY," Good! Use it! Neil Armstrong was overwhelmed when he walked on the Moon, but you know what he did? He walked on the Moon! Charles, you're in charge of food."
CHARLES," I've been planning a nuptial menu since the day I met Genevieve. Warning, it will be delicious and highly erotic."
ROSA," Your menu is not gonna involve animal genitalia, is it?"
CHARLES," No, I was gonna make not that."
AMY," Terry, you're on hair and makeup. I've seen your little girls' pigtails, so I know you can do it."
TERRY, They actually prefer my hair work to their mommy's. I love their little heads.
ROSA," Terry, what's going on, man?"
TERRY, It's just a matter of time before I'm doing their hair at their weddings. It goes so fast. They're still babies!
AMY," Pull it together, Jeffords! Scully and Hitchcock, you're in charge of seating."
SCULLY," Smart move, Amy. I've been called the Leonardo da Vinci of sitting on my ass."
AMY," Great. And, Captain, you can help me decorate."
HOLT," I'm at your disposal, just tell me what to do. I'm here to implement your vision."
AMY," Well, we just wanna keep it classy."
HOLT, Got it. Balloon arch.
AMY, What?
HOLT," Say no more, it's done. I'm off to the nearest balloon store. "
AMY," Okay, Rosa. You go to the office, have a couple bellinis, and just relax."
ROSA, What's a Bellini?
AMY, Peach juice and champagne.
ROSA," Peach juice and champagne? What am I, six?"
AMY," Come on, just try it. It's what Nancy Meyers would drink."
ROSA, Fine. For Nancy.
JAKE," So, big day. How you feeling, buddy?"
PIMENTO," Good, giddy. I've never felt giddy before. Didn't realize how close it was to hungry."
JAKE," You know, it's possible you're just hungry. When's the last time you ate?"
PIMENTO," Uh, three days ago?"
JAKE, Ah.
GINA, You excited for being married?
PIMENTO," Yeah! I love Rosa. I can't wait to just jam my tongue in her earholes, and eat the hair off her head. Hoo! I'm giddy."
GINA," Aw, that's cute."
JAKE," All right, we're looking for 381 Smith Street. It should be up here. Hopefully they still have your earrings."
GINA, You sure we're looking for 381? 'Cause 381's looking a little crispy.
PIMENTO," Oh, no. It burned down. How did this happen?"
JAKE," Uh, it's okay. Everything's gonna be fine. We'll think of something, all right?"
PIMENTO," Nope! This is a sign from the universe. I can't marry Rosa. Guys, (he pauses) the wedding's off."
PIMENTO," Oh, no, no, no! (He groans) That's it! We're not getting married. This is a disaster."
JAKE," Come on. I mean, they're just earrings, right? We can get another pair, (Pimento looks shocked) or we could make some new ones. All we need is, like, a blacksmith. Or a smelter a smelt man- that can't be right. The point is you can still married."
PIMENTO," No, Jake. You don't understand. The universe is sending me a sign. And when the universe talks, I listen!"
JAKE," Well, I personally don't even really believe in signs, so-"
PIMENTO, What? Then you deserve to die.
JAKE, Ah
PIMENTO," The sign was real. If I ignore it and marry Rosa anyway, I'm basically asking the universe to stomp on my balls."
JAKE," Okay, good point. (He turns to Gina) Hey, Gina, I could use your help here. You wanna maybe weigh in on this one?"
GINA," Yeah, sure. (She turns to Pimento) You're right. The marriage is cursed."
JAKE, What? No! You weighed in wrong.
GINA," I'm sorry, Jake, it's an omen. And I'm not taking your side against the universe's, it's hundred of years old."
JAKE, What if there was something in the universe that could prove to you that you should still get married? What would that be?
GINA," Finding his grandma's earrings. Or we could cut Rosa's ears off, and then it's like the earrings don't even make sense."
PIMENTO, Thank you! Someone's trying to help.
JAKE," Okay, so the earrings. (Jake starts typing on his phone) Maybe somebody bought them before the place burned down, right? We could track 'em down. And lookee here. (He holds his phone up) I just got the owner's name. That's good, right?"
PIMENTO," Okay, maybe there is a little bit of hope."
JAKE," (Snaps his fingers) You're damn right there is. (He then looks up and points at the sky) Suck it, universe!"
PIMENTO, Are you crazy?
GINA, Why would you even say that?
PIMENTO," Come on, man!"
AMY," How are the chairs coming, guys?"
HITCHCOCK, Shh. We're working!
SCULLY, (He starts bouncing on the chair) This one's good.
AMY, Okay. So we'll go with that one?
SCULLY," No, I said it was good. I didn't say it was right."
AMY," Wow, you're taking this really seriously."
CHARLES," Amy, will you taste this batter?"
AMY," Mm-hmm. (She leans forwards and tastes the batter. Hmm, (she makes an unsure face) I think it's a little off."
CHARLES, You know what's off? Your mouth!
CHARLES," Why Jake lets your stupid tongue anywhere near him, I'll never know. (He tastes the batter himself and looks disgusted) Nope, I forgot the sugar. That's on me."
AMY," Whoa, you really made the balloon arch."
HOLT," Made? No. I birthed her. There's no form more graceful than the arch, no object more whimsical than the balloon."
AMY," Yes, you and I think that, but what will Rosa think?"
HOLT," Good point. Rosa would want a much, much bigger balloon arch. Back to the balloon store."
TERRY," Uh, Amy? We've got a problem."
AMY, What?
TERRY, Rosa's drunk.
AMY, Rosa? No. How?
ROSA," Bellinis rule! Nancy Meyers, you've done it again, you saucy bitch."
SHOP OWNER," For the last time, I don't have your earrings. They didn't survive the fire."
GINA," Aw, no, this is really bad."
JAKE," Well, not necessarily. I mean, maybe the universe allowed something else to survive, you know? Like a rabbit's foot."
SHOP OWNER, I don't think you understand how pawn shops work.
JAKE, I don't think you understand how they work. Yours burned down! I'm so sorry you lost everything. I'm just really worked up.
JAKE," No, please don't!"
JAKE," Okay, so I know that seemed like a little bit of a dead end. (He chuckles)"
PIMENTO, She's got the earrings.
JAKE, She does?
PIMENTO," She stole all the merch, and then burned down the store. She was wearing a necklace that I also pawned there."
GINA," Oh, snap! Signs on signs on signs!"
JAKE, Are you sure it's the same necklace?
PIMENTO," Uh, yeah, Jake. I once punched it through a guy's throat, so I'm pretty sure I remember it."
JAKE," I stand corrected. All right, I'm gonna call the local police and get a warrant. (He starts typing on his phone."
PIMENTO," Oh, don't bother. Let's just kick down the door, and take back what's mine."
JAKE," No! No, no, no. That's a bad idea."
GINA, He's right. Just use the lattice. The upstairs window's open.
JAKE, No!
PIMENTO, Nice! (He then runs off)
JAKE, What are you doing?
GINA, I'm trying to make this wedding happen. What are you doing?
JAKE," Trying to keep us out of prison. You know what, forget it. I'll just deal with him myself (he turns around to see where Pimento went) nope, he's already on the roof."
GINA," Aha! Yeah, dog! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
AMY," Rosa, what happened?"
ROSA," Sorry. I didn't know you could drunk off champers. I mean, it's half bubbles."
CHARLES," Don't worry, Amy. I got this. I'm a master at sobering up."
AMY, Are you sure?
CHARLES," Uh, you don't go to the Renaissance Faire every weekend in your 20s without learning how to handle your mead."
AMY," Great. Thanks, Charles."
CHARLES, Mm-hmm.
ROSA," Charles, I'm getting married today."
CHARLES," Yes, you are. And I'm gonna make sure you are sober when that happens. Now I just need cayenne pepper and some horse milk."
ROSA," Marriage is the best. Hey, how come you and Genevieve aren't married? Huh?"
CHARLES," Uh, you know, it's complicated."
ROSA," No, it's not. It's easy. Bring her down here. We'll all get married!"
CHARLES," Yeah, right. She doesn't want that."
ROSA," Whoa, that sounds."
CHARLES," No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Uh-uh, no, no."
CHARLES," Everything's great with us. I mean, if it was up to me, we'd get hitched, but she had a really bad divorce, so-"
ROSA," Oh, I'm sorry. Does that upset you?"
CHARLES," I'm good! Yeah, I'm good!"
CHARLES, I'm so sad. I love her so much. I wanna marry her butt so bad.
ROSA, To Genevieve's butt!
CHARLES, To Genevieve's butt!
PIMENTO," Look at all this crap. See, I told you. They took all their merchandise, and burned their store."
JAKE, This is a bad idea. We should leave now.
PIMENTO," What? No. All we're gonna do is find the earrings, and then light this place on fire for revenge."
GINA, Check it out! (She picks up a wooden rainstick) Rainstick. Keeping it.
JAKE," No, you're not. That is a crime."
GINA," Untrue. Once you steal something, none of your stuff belongs to you."
PIMENTO, I've heard that too.
JAKE," No, you haven't. No one has. Put that down."
GINA, Okay. (She turns the rainstick over causing it to make trickling sound)
JAKE, Gina! Be a quieter robber!
GINA, But you told me to put it down.
JAKE," Hi, we met earlier."
SHOP OWNER, You're breaking into my house?
GINA, Or are you breaking into our house?
JAKE, Yeah.
SHOP OWNER, Dino! Robbers! Dino!
PIMENTO, Aha! I found the earrings!
SHOP OWNER, Dino! Get up here!
PIMENTO," Yeah, Dino! Get in here! So you can watch me light your house on fire!"
JAKE," Whoa! Okay, everybody, just keep it cool. Everybody be chilly chill chill."
DINO, I am gonna slice your face off!
JAKE," Not chill, Dino."
DINO," Let me in there, you sons of bitches!"
JAKE," Wait, wait! The trellis won't hold all three of us at the same time."
GINA, Smart.
PIMENTO," Look at all this crap. See, I told you. They took all their merchandise, and burned their store."
JAKE, This is a bad idea. We should leave now.
PIMENTO," What? No. All we're gonna do is find the earrings, and then light this place on fire for revenge."
GINA, Check it out! Rainstick. Keeping it.
JAKE," No, you're not. That is a crime."
GINA," Untrue. Once you steal something, none of your stuff belongs to you."
PIMENTO, I've heard that too.
JAKE," No, you haven't. No one has. Put that down."
GINA, Okay.
JAKE, Gina! Be a quieter robber!
GINA, But you told me to put it down.
JAKE," Hi, we met earlier."
SHOP OWNER, You're breaking into my house?
GINA, Or are you breaking into our house?
JAKE, Yeah.
SHOP OWNER,  Dino! Robbers! Dino!
PIMENTO, Aha! I found the earrings!
SHOP OWNER, Dino! Get up here!
PIMENTO," Yeah, Dino! Get in here! So you can watch me light your house on fire!"
JAKE," Whoa! Okay, everybody, just keep it cool. Everybody be chilly chill chill."
DINO, I am gonna slice your face off!
JAKE," Not chill, Dino."
DINO," Let me in there, you sons of bitches!"
JAKE," Wait, wait! The trellis won't hold all three of us at the same time."
GINA, Smart.
PIMENTO, This is the worst day of my life. The universe doesn't want me to marry Rosa.
JAKE," Look, it's gonna be fine. We'll get the car fixed and make it back in time. Gina, when's the tow truck getting here?"
GINA," No idea, I'm talking to my spiritual adviser. He says we have an engine problem."
JAKE," Yeah, I know, that's why I said call a tow truck!"
GINA, So you meant my spiritual adviser is right?
PIMENTO," Guys! This is my fault. I should've just given up when fate burned down the pawn shop, okay? Stupid Adrian. (He starts shouting at himself) Stupid Adrian! Idiot! Read the signs!"
JAKE," Enough! I'm so sick of this garbage, all right? The two of you need to stop looking for signs everywhere- (Jake notices a sign giving the direction of an Airport) oh, my God, a sign."
GINA," Whoo! He can fly! Prop planes! You can fly, you can fly!"
JAKE, I'm a vessel for the universe.
AMY, Wow. The chairs look amazing. I can't believe you two aren't my biggest problem today.
HITCHCOCK, We're not? Who is?
HOLT, My arch. Isn't she beautiful?
SCULLY," I got eye-rolled to, not about!"
HOLT," While Pimento stares at Rosa, we'll all be staring at her."
AMY," Yes, we will."
HOLT," She's truly breathtaking. There's a double meaning to that. The breath that it takes to inflate all those balloons. Of course I used the hand pump, but the bon mot still works."
AMY," Oh, no! What's happening? Someone tell me what's happening."
TERRY, I got some more bad news.
AMY, Oh.
TERRY," Oh, wow. That thing's huge. Didn't Rosa want things to be classy? I mean, she's getting married, not finishing a marathon."
HOLT," So says the hair guy. Stay in your lane, bucko. Right, Santiago?"
AMY," The arch sucks! I'm sorry. I didn't want to say anything because you're my boss and you were so excited, but the truth is every time I look at it I wanna die and take you with me."
HOLT," Well, I wish you'd said something before I spent all day making it. Of course, you didn't want to ""burst my bubble"". Pun intended. And then you did."
TERRY, Forget the arch! Charles didn't sober up Rosa. She got him drunk!
AMY," Oh, no. How drunk is he?"
TERRY," Remember the night they cancelled ""Bunheads""?"
AMY, We're ruined.
TERRY, It's fine. I'll handle it. You got your hands full.
AMY, Yeah.
TERRY," This is just 18 shots of espresso. It got me through the first three months of having twins, but I imagine it'll sober you up too."
CHARLES," Aww, he's taking care of you. Such a good father."
ROSA," Ugh, I miss my father. I used to be daddy's little girl, but we never talk anymore."
TERRY, You don't?
ROSA," That's what happens. You grow up, your bond with your dad goes (She blows raspberries followed by Charles doing the same)"
TERRY," No, it doesn't always happen. All right, not to special daddies who put the time in. You know, read them stories, do their little pigtails."
ROSA," Really, Sarge? Who do you think used to do my pigtails?"
TERRY, Why can't they stay babies forever?
ROSA, Berlini!
CHARLES, Bellini!
TERRY, Bellini!
JAKE," Okay, this is very scary, but it's okay, because you're a trained pilot."
PIMENTO," No, I'm not. I'm self-taught."
JAKE, What?
PIMENTO," Oh, yeah. You can learn anything online. Ooh, you should see me do origami."
GINA," Oh, do you know how to do a frog?"
PIMENTO," Oh, no!"
GINA, Can you do a swan?
PIMENTO, No.
GINA, Can you do a crane?
PIMENTO, What's a crane?
GINA," Okay, he does not know how to fly a plane."
AMY," All right, food is ready, decorations are set, guests should start arriving any moment, and the chairs are still perfection."
SCULLY," She said they're perfection. I'm so proud of you, buddy."
HITCHCOCK, It was you. You made this happen.
AMY, All right! Let's show Rosa what we got. Wait. Where is Rosa?
ROSA, Narc.
TERRY, And that's why you shouldn't drink.
CHARLES, Being drunk sounds terrible.
ROSA," Hello, Amy, I didn't see you there. How did the wedding go?"
AMY," Terry! What the hell, man? You said you were gonna sober them up."
TERRY, It was her fault. My girls are never gonna grow up and lose their virginity.
CHARLES, I lost my V-card to the woman that refilled Nana's oxygen tanks.
CHARLES, Her hands were so strong from turning the nozzles.
AMY, This is a room of nightmares.
HOLT, You're the nightmare.
HOLT," You made me kill my balloon baby. Look at me. So drunk, I'm alliterating like a beatnik."
AMY," Okay, everybody outside now!"
AMY, Just know that you brought this on yourselves.
CHARLES," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Can't we just go to sleep for a winker?"
AMY," We're way past winkers. Scully, Hitchcock, bring the frost."
AMY," Nice job, you two."
HITCHCOCK, We are nailing it today!
JAKE," Hey! We're back. Pimento's got the earrings, guests are arriving- (Jake turns to Terry, Charles, Holt and Rosa) What the hell are you doing?"
AMY," Sobering these clowns up. All right, everyone go get dressed."
JAKE, You would not believe the day I've had.
AMY," You and me both, sister. Rosa got drunk, and then every time I sent someone in to help her, she got them drunk too! It's like she was trying to tank this thing."
JAKE," Yeah, well, Pimento called off the wedding three times because of the universe. If I didn't know them any better, I'd think they don't even wanna get married."
JAKE AND AMY, They don't wanna get married!
JAKE," Okay, so it seems like they don't wanna get married. But is it even our place to say something? No, right?"
AMY," Right? It's their decision, even if it's a bad one. They could always get divorced."
JAKE," People love getting divorced! My parents got divorced, and all it did was scar our family for years and years."
AMY, We have to say something.
JAKE, Yeah.
HOLT, I suppose I can see how a balloon arch might've been a little too much.
TERRY," Oh, yeah, for sure."
HOLT," No, you're supposed to say, ""This wedding looks like garbage""."
TERRY, This wedding looks like garbage.
HOLT," No, no. As long as the bride's happy."
JAKE," Hey there, everyone. Great wedding so far, right? Uh, next up, we're gonna take a quick break, which happens at every wedding, but in the meantime, how about a little entertainment? Boyle? You got your devil sticks?"
CHARLES, Always.
JAKE," Hey, Adrian."
PIMENTO, Yeah.
JAKE, We gotta talk.
PIMENTO, Really? Right now? I'm working on my vows. Hey! (He snaps his fingers) What rhymes with juicy heinie?
JAKE, Nothing. Nothing rhymes with that. I would cut that line.
PIMENTO, But that's all I have.
JAKE," Forget it. The thing I wanna say is, maybe the universe wasn't telling you stuff today. Maybe you were telling yourself something."
PIMENTO, Telling myself what?
GINA," Yeah, tell himself what?"
JAKE, What are you doing here?
GINA, I'm a part of this journey. Don't you dare try to cut me out.
AMY," Wow, you look beautiful."
ROSA," Thanks, Amy. I'm super nervous. Kinda wish I was still drunk."
AMY, Yeah. About that I think we should talk.
ROSA, Why? Are you packing a Bellini?
JAKE," Look, I spent the whole day denying the fact that there were signs, but I was wrong. They were actually there."
PIMENTO," So far, duh."
JAKE, The fact that you kept cancelling your own wedding that was the real sign.
GINA," Whoa! You took the situation, and you flippity-flopped it."
AMY," I don't think it was an accident that you got drunk, or that you got everyone else drunk."
ROSA, What? You think I'm trying to sabotage my own wedding?
AMY, I don't know. Were you?
ROSA," Maybe I was. I don't know, something just doesn't feel right. Oh, man, I gotta talk to Adrian."
PIMENTO," I was my own sign the whole time? Wow, that's a real M. Night Shyamalan twist the- oh! ""Signs""!"
PIMENTO," Wait, do you think he's behind all of this?"
JAKE, I do not.
PIMENTO," I should go talk to Rosa. Thanks, Jake. He walks off."
GINA," Jake, you done good, kid. Glad I took you along for the ride. (She walks off)"
CHARLES," Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!"
JAKE," All right, give it up for Charles."
CHARLES," No, give it up for the devil sticks. They're the real heroes here."
JAKE," No, they are not. No one thinks that. All right, I'm not sure how much time we have, but anybody know a joke?"
HITCHCOCK," Oh, I do! Two Jews walk into a-"
JAKE," No! Sit down! No, definitely not. Oh! "
PIMENTO," All right, we have an announcement to make."
ROSA, We're not getting married.
ALL, Aww!
ROSA," You can shove those ""awws"" up your butts."
PIMENTO," Yeah, or I'll come out there, and I'll do it for ya!"
JAKE, What an interesting event.
ROSA," I just feel like we were rushing things. We love each other, but we haven't even really spent that much time together. We've never even been on a real date, so we're gonna start there."
PIMENTO, Shut up! Thank you for the presents. We're keeping them.
ROSA, All of them.
PIMENTO," Yeah, if you got a problem with it, come talk to us in the parking lot."
ROSA," Also, in just 14 hours Amy put together the most amazing non-wedding wedding in history."
AMY," Better than ""Sleepless in Seattle""."
PIMENTO, Nope. That is also Nora Ephron. Kill yourself.
JAKE, Don't take it personally.
ROSA," Anyway, we can't let all this go to waste. Everybody, clear these chairs out of here, and let's get this party started."
HITCHCOCK," No, not the chairs!"
SCULLY," Don't touch the chairs, you monsters!"
HOLT, Yeah?
ROSA," Oh, I just wanted to thank you for all your help yesterday."
HOLT, I didn't do much. It was nothing. Good day.
ROSA, What's going on?
HOLT, I'm just very busy. Get back to work.
ROSA, Wait. What do you have in there? 
HOLT, A balloon arch.
ROSA," Oh, my God, Captain. She is magnificent."
HOLT, Vindication!
JAKE," Hey there, Boyle. How was your weekend?"
CHARLES," Well, actually I got a little sick."
JAKE," Oh, really? I'm sorry to hear that, man."
CHARLES," Yeah, ""Bullets over Broadway"" was on TV. And I came down with a big ol' Dianne Wiest infection."
CHARLES," Like ""yeast""."
HOLT, So I'll coordinate with the transit cops while you follow up with the DA's office.
HOLT," Uh, can I help you, Captain Stentley?"
HOLT, I did not.
JAKE, No.
JAKE, Why? What's in the backpack?
HOLT," Oh, yeah, he's a big-time supplier, consolidated half the territory in Brooklyn."
JAKE, And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.
JAKE, I'd say it's a very-
JAKE," Okay, um, no biggie."
JAKE," Nope, very common police expression."
JAKE," This is our chance. If C.J. can't find that evidence, he could be fired. This could be our way back onto the day shift."
JAKE, Come on and party tonight. Wow! It's actually a really catchy song.
HOLT, There's nothing to celebrate. Captain Stentley is going to find that evidence because we're gonna help him.
JAKE," What? No, this is our chance to undermine him. Come on and party tonight."
HOLT," Peralta, we're police officers. We have a duty to protect this city. We took an oath, a sacred oath. What if those drugs end up on the street or a dangerous criminal is set free because of missing evidence?"
JAKE," Okay, you know, you're trying to say it's whatever because you just..."
HOLT, You're fumfering.
JAKE," Of course I'm fumfering. Fine, we'll find the bag. Come on and party tonight. Damn it."
TERRY," Hey, guys, department has a new green initiative. We have to reduce energy usage by 15%. That means no more laminating, Santiago."
AMY," Oh, that's fine. It's not the thing that gives me the most pleasure in life. Interacting with other people, that's what gets me going."
TERRY," Scully, Hitchcock, lose the chocolate fountain."
SCULLY, What are we supposed to dip our strawberries in? Our nacho cheese fountain? That's crazy.
HITCHCOCK, Unless.s
HITCHCOCK," Sarge, you beautiful bastard."
TERRY, Get rid of 'em.
TERRY," And, Gina, you can't run that space heater 24/7 anymore."
GINA," Space heater? Excuse me, this is a Fornax Radiant Comfort System, and her name is Jacinta."
TERRY," Okay, well, Jacinta's gotta go."
GINA," He didn't mean that, darling."
TERRY," Seriously, turn off the space heater."
GINA, No.
TERRY," Do it, now. That's an order."
GINA," Yeah, well, you don't wanna start a battle of the wills with Gina Linetti because you will emerge from that battle a broken man. Not to brag, but I was name-checked in my kindergarten teacher's suicide note."
TERRY," Oh, my God."
HOLT, Any luck finding the missing backpack?
JAKE," No, but I did find C.J.'s wallet, badge, and gun on top of the toilet paper dispenser. I'm assuming he doesn't know they're missing."
HOLT, Mm.
JAKE," Why are you helping this guy, sir? He's the opposite of everything you stand for. His favorite expression is ""that's gonna leave a mark."" And he doesn't even use it right."
JAKE, What?
HOLT," Well, he's not our best, but I won't be part of any sneaky subterfuge designed to undermine him."
JAKE," You think you're so great just 'cause you always do what's good and right. Well, I've got news for you:"
JAKE, Ya boring.
HOLT," You know who else was called ""boring""? Andreas Marggraf. And you know what he did?"
JAKE," He discovered zinc, because you've used that one on me before because, uh, ya boring."
HOLT," Well, if I'm so boring, how come I have a lead? Come take a look at this."
HOLT," This is security footage from the day the backpack went missing. 11:00 a.m., the bag's over a chair. Now let's fast forward and see what happened to it."
JAKE," Wait, that was two hours? Where's C.J. during all this?"
JAKE," Party tonight. The guy's got good hooks. I mean, right?"
JAKE," Wait, who's this guy? Flaco must've sent someone to get the backpack, and they just waltzed right in and took it out of the precinct. Oh, C.J. is in so much trouble."
JAKE," You think that disapproving glare works on me after all the times I've seen it? Step it up, find something new."
JAKE, Ya boring.
CHARLES," 'Ello, me lady. It's your matey lil' Charlie Boyle, innit, love?"
ROSA," Ugh, it's 2:00 a.m., and we're working. How can you be so happy?"
CHARLES, Because I figured out the secret of surviving the night shift. You see:
CHARLES, This little piggy went to the warehouse. This little piggy went with him. This little piggy was like-
ROSA," Stop, just stop and say whatever you are saying another way."
CHARLES," I found a 24-hour foot massage parlor, and it's amazing."
CHARLES, Mmm-
CHARLES," Ahh, wha?"
ROSA," Wouldn't stop making that noise, man."
CHARLES," Let me take you, let me show you the greatest and only pleasure of the night shift."
ROSA," Pass, I'd rather die than have a stranger touch my bare feet."
CHARLES," I'm telling you, once they get get their strong fingers in your toe gaps, it's just mmm-"
CHARLES," Uh, that's on me, shouldn't have had my eyes closed."
JAKE," Hey, C.J., you upset about something, man? Maybe something in your career?"
JAKE," Yeah, well, you told me to sugarcoat it."
JAKE, Yours.
JAKE," Okay, so what happened? I mean, they couldn't have fired you, right? That'd be crazy. I mean, they could, for sure, they had every reason to, but did they? Did they fire you?"
JAKE," What transfer, what now?"
JAKE," Completely unqualified, yeah."
JAKE, Yeah.
JAKE," Wait, you wanna train other officers?"
JAKE, That's a six-month program.
JAKE," No, no, no, no, no, no. All is not lost. We can still fix this. So, sure, maybe you can't get back the backpack, but you could do something even better."
JAKE," Like, what if you single-handedly figure out who Flaco is and then you take him down."
JAKE," No, you won't, because I will be there to help you, but don't worry, you'll still get all the credit. Listen to me, C.J., we're gonna get you the hell out of here."
JAKE, I most certainly am not.
JAKE, Ahh.
JAKE," So, Captain, I've been thinking about this whole missing backpack thing, and, what if we find Flaco and take him down?"
HOLT," Oh, are you trying to solve C.J.'s case behind his back to embarrass him?"
JAKE," No, not at all. In fact, I think C.J. should come along. I just realized how important my duty as a police officer is to me, you know? The sacred oath I took. Your speech really inspired me."
HOLT," Well, it was one of my better ones. Felt really good as I was saying it."
JAKE, Yeah.
HOLT," So what's the plan, son?"
JAKE," Well, Dad, we don't know where Flaco is, but I have a C.I. who says he's got an agreement with Marco Severino."
HOLT, So you think we should pose as drug dealers looking for a new heroin supplier and get Severino to hook us up with Flaco. And you think C.J. can handle this mission?
JAKE," I know he's inexperienced, but he's a creative guy. I think he'd be great undercover."
JAKE," Great start, and I love your double use of ""muchachos."""
AMY," Oooh, that's a nice lam' job. This one goes on the blog."
AMY," Hey, Sarge, what up, bro?"
TERRY," ""What up, bro?"" You're laminating in here, aren't you?"
AMY, I'm sorry. I just love it so much.
TERRY," It's okay, I'm used to it. No one listens to me. I'm a lousy sergeant."
AMY," What? No, don't say that. Why would you say that?"
TERRY," If I tell you something, you promise not to tell anyone else?"
AMY, Of course.
TERRY, You know how I took the lieutenant's exam last week?
AMY, Uh-huh.
TERRY, I just found out I didn't pass.
AMY," Oh, no, but you shouldn't feel bad, only like 10% of people pass on the first try."
TERRY," I know, and I'm all exhausted because of the night shift, plus my bathroom break during the test took a little longer than anticipated."
TERRY," May I use the restroom, please?"
TERRY," Uh-oh, nothing to see here."
TERRY," Excuse me, I'm sorry. Little desk."
AMY," That's why they say ""it's test time, so diaper up."""
AMY," They say that, I've never said that. I've never worn a diaper during test. Who would wear a diaper during a test? That's ridiculous, I mean-"
TERRY, Santiago.
AMY," Sorry. Look, don't give up on the green initiative. You're a great sergeant. You'll get everyone on board."
TERRY, Not Gina.
AMY," Yes, Gina. You can handle her. You can do this. Sarge, it's test time."
TERRY, Diaper up.
CHARLES, Thank you for coming along with me on this manhunt. I needed your help.
ROSA," No problem, who are we looking for?"
ROSA, You're taking me to that foot massage place.
CHARLES, I am taking you to the foot massage place. I made that whole thing up.
ROSA, Shocking.
CHARLES," Look, the night shift hasn't been easy on any of us. Let me make it slightly better by paying a strong-handed woman to literally milk the stress from your feet."
ROSA," Just shut up, I'll do it once."
CHARLES, Yes!
ROSA, As long as you promise to never ever talk about foot milk again.
CHARLES," Deal, you're gonna love it."
ROSA," I guarantee you, I won't."
BOTH, Mmm.
JAKE," All right, that's Severino's restaurant. My C.I. says he's in there."
JAKE, Not at all. How about you?
HOLT, I think it might be better if you stayed in the van.
HOLT, Yes.
JAKE," But just because you're in the van doesn't mean you're not an important part of the mission. Your job will be to keep an eye on the restaurant. And, if anybody suspicious walks in, you just-"
JAKE, Don't try and guess where I'm going with it.
JAKE," You keep an eye on the door. If anyone suspicious walks in, let us know in our ear pieces."
JAKE," C.J., I'm loving the story, but we gotta go in."
JAKE, TBC.
TERRY," Thanks for hand-laminating, Santiago."
AMY," Of course, if you ask me, saving energy is trending."
AMY," Oh, Gina, didn't see you there."
TERRY," Gina, did you shut off your space heater yet?"
GINA, Space heater... Doesn't ring any bells.
TERRY, Jacinta.
GINA," Oh, no, she's still going strong."
TERRY," I will take that thing away from you by force, if necessary."
GINA," Well, come and get it."
TERRY, Seriously? The heater's under your skirt?
GINA, Maybe. You can't prove that.
TERRY," Yeah, I can. There's a cord running under it, and I think you may be on fire."
GINA," Mm, so?"
TERRY," What do you mean ""so""?"
GINA, I'm not giving up Jacinta.
TERRY," You are on fire, Gina. You do not have the upper hand in this situation."
GINA, I always have the upper hand.
TERRY, Not when there's flames shooting out of your butt!
GINA, Especially when there's flames shooting out of my butt.
TERRY, Damn it.
TERRY, How the hell did I lose that one?
JAKE," Hey, you Severino?"
SEVERINO, Who wants to know?
JAKE," I'm Cal, this is Billy. We used to buy from Rosario, but he got busted by the feds, and we're looking for a new hookup."
SEVERINO, I knew Rosario.
JAKE," Well, you can ask Rosario's guys about us."
HOLT, I didn't come here to be accused of something.
SEVERINO," Hold up, I got a right to know who I might be in business with."
JAKE," Sorry, bad allergy day, pollen count is off the charts."
SEVERINO, So what's your territory?
JAKE, We don't sell on the streets. We have loyal buyers that come to us.
HOLT," And we need quality product, our customers are discerning."
SEVERINO, I got a guy that could get you the best dope in the city.
SEVERINO, But it ain't gonna be cheap.
JAKE," I'm sorry, you think we wanna deal with complete strangers?"
JAKE," I mean, we gotta cover our own asses."
JAKE, How do we know this guy's even legit?
JAKE, Shut up!
HOLT, Stop talking!
JAKE," Shut up, now!"
HOLT," Oh, my God."
JAKE," Shut up, C.J."
SEVERINO," Oh, whoa, whoa, what are you, cops?"
JAKE," Yes, obviously we're cops. Put your hands up."
HOLT, Stop talking!
HOLT," Crime scene investigators combed every inch of Severino's restaurant, no drugs."
JAKE," Well, we can't hold him much longer, and he's not talking. The interrogation did not exactly go well."
JAKE," You're gonna tell us who Flaco is, and you're gonna tell us right now-"
JASON," Oh, that was crazy."
HOLT," Well, there's one bit of good news. The last call on Severino's phone was to a contact we believe to be Flaco. We've tracked his location to a warehouse by the water. We're gonna storm the place."
JAKE," Great, I'll go get C.J."
HOLT, Why? Why are you so determined to make him a part of this?
JAKE, No reason.
HOLT," If you actually cared about your sacred oath, you'd see that he's a risk to the case."
HOLT," Oh, my speech didn't actually inspire you, did it?"
JAKE," Ugh, alright, here's the truth. If we catch Flaco, and C.J. gets credit for it, he's gonna transfer out of the Nine-Nine."
HOLT, That's what this is all about? You're still trying to undermine the man?
JAKE," What? No! The opposite, if anything. I want to see him succeed. I'm trying to overmine him."
HOLT," Oh, you know I hate it - when you make up words, Peralta."
JAKE," Are you still mad at me for saying ""snaccident""?"
HOLT," Yes, very."
JAKE," Please, just let him come along."
HOLT, No.
JAKE, Just so his name is on the arrest report.
HOLT, No.
JAKE, I'll put him in a car a block away.
HOLT, Fine.
HOLT, At least tell me what it was about my speech that didn't work for you.
JAKE," Oh, man, if I had to boil it down to one thing and really pinpoint it, I guess I would just say it's, uh, ya boring."
JAKE, But still let him come? Great.
TERRY, What is all this?
GINA," Oh, hey, Sarge. I'm growing tropical plants now in the warmth of my three space heaters. It's getting a little hot though, wouldn't you say?"
GINA," Ugh, oh, yeah. Probably also turn on my portable air conditioning unit."
GINA, Boop.
GINA, My whole life is last stands.
AMY," Gina, can I talk to you for a second?"
GINA," Yeah, what's up?"
GINA," Let me guess, you and Jake are having problems; you want me to teach you how to kiss?"
AMY," What? No, stop that."
GINA, Oh.
AMY," I know how I kiss, I've read books. This is about Terry. You can't tell anyone else this, but-"
GINA, He failed his lieutenant's exam.
AMY, How do you know that?
GINA, Let's just say my little birds are everywhere collecting whispers.
GINA," He left the letter on his desk, and I read it."
AMY," Okay, but if you know he's depressed, then why are you being so hard on him?"
GINA," Don't worry, I got this. Just clear the lane and let Gina do her thing."
AMY, What? Ugh.
AMY, Gina? You locked me in.
GINA, Going to lunch.
AMY," Gina, you know I'm very claustrophobic."
HOLT, Everybody ready? Where's C.J.?
JAKE," Parked a block away on Winthrop, as promised. Don't worry, he's not going anywhere. I downloaded an app on his phone that makes your words sound like burps."
HOLT," Smart, really smart."
JAKE, Yeah.
HOLT," Here we go, on three, two, one."
POLICE OFFICER," NYPD, on the ground."
SHADY MAN," Flaco, run!"
JAKE, That's Flaco.
JAKE," It's locked, go back."
JAKE," C.J., that's Flaco. You got him."
HOLT," He's out cold, how'd you do it?"
JAKE," No, no, wait. Let me guess. You opened your car door into him."
JAKE, He never saw it coming.
JAKE, And neither did you. It was a total accident; you were getting out of your car to go pee.
JAKE," Damn it, how did I not guess that?"
ROSA," Charles, this is amazing."
CHARLES," I know, when's the last time you cried like that?"
ROSA, Huh? You cried?
CHARLES," Damn right, I did."
ROSA," Oh, guess we gotta get back to the Nine-Nine."
CHARLES," Let's not be hasty. Neither of us have any open cases right now, so should we tell the ladies we're ready for round two?"
ROSA," Let's do it, you insatiable little minx. I'll go get 'em."
CHARLES, Mmm.
ROSA," Charles, this place is a front, money laundering or something."
CHARLES, We gotta get out of here right now.
HOLT," I just got off the phone with One Police Plaza. They're thrilled. Captain Stentley, you got your transfer."
JAKE, Whoo!
JAKE," What, why?"
JAKE, More the door than you.
JAKE, Oh.
JAKE, That's gonna leave a mark.
JAKE," I can't believe this. Not only are we still stuck on the night shift, but now we have to watch C.J. get a medal. Why are there so many reporters? Even ""The Times"" is here."
HOLT," Wait, really? Who'd they send? Wilson, Palmer, Schneier, Levine, Rogers, Tyler, Baker, Correal, Bromwich, Robbins, Schmidt?"
JAKE, Stop saying reporters' names. How do you know so many names?
HOLT, They're the only real rock stars we have left.
JAKE, Okay.
POLICE CHIEF," Hello, we're here today to honor Captain Jason Stentley, who single-handedly brought down a major drug ring."
POLICE CHIEF, And so it is my pleasure to bestow upon him the Medal of Honor. Captain Stentley.
POLICE CHIEF," Thank you, thank you, Captain."
POLICE CHIEF, That- that is- that's plenty.
JAKE, That was a train wreck.
HOLT," Yes, he never should have been put in that position."
JAKE," Wait, what are you saying?"
HOLT," Oh, nothing. It just seems as if C.J. has been ""overmined""."
JAKE, You did this?
HOLT, I did.
JAKE, And you used my made-up word.
HOLT," I hated it, ""overmined"". What have I become? Was this whole thing even worth it?"
JAKE, It was no snaccident.
ROSA," So the foot massage place reported $7 million in profit last year. To make that much, they'd have to massage 100 feet an hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the entire year."
CHARLES," Damn it, we have to shut them down."
ROSA, Wait. Let's not be hasty about this. Let's think this through. We wanna be smart about this.
CHARLES," Right, I mean, what if we bust them tonight, and then tomorrow I'm chasing a murderer, and I'm about to get him, and my foot cramps up?"
ROSA, Due to lack of massaging.
CHARLES, And then the murderer gets away.
ROSA, Know who he kills next? The mayor.
CHARLES," Oh, my God, the city has no mayor now."
ROSA," It's chaos. Rioting, looting, panic in the streets."
CHARLES," They gotta call in the National Guard, there's tanks rolling down 5th Avenue, declaring martial law."
ROSA, It's insane. All because we shut down the foot massage place.
CHARLES, That was doing God's work. What were we thinking?
ROSA, So it's agreed: we let them stay open for the sake of the city.
CHARLES, For the sake of the city.
ROSA," We have to do our stupid jobs, don't we?"
CHARLES," Yeah, let me get my stupid gun."
ROSA," NYPD, get down on the comfortable matted floor."
CHARLES, Put your magical hands where we can see them.
ROSA, You're under arrest for ruining something perfect.
CHARLES, And money laundering.
ROSA," Yes, money laundering, whatever."
TERRY," Gina, I've been thinking a lot about how you refuse to give up Jacinta."
GINA, That's right. She's never leaving.
TERRY," I know, which is why I decided to do the only fair thing. Space heaters for everyone."
GINA, So what? That sounds great.
TERRY, Everyone.
HITCHCOCK," Whoo-whee, it's toasty in here."
TERRY," You're gonna be looking at that all night long. Whoop, I think he's about to eat a hoagie."
TERRY, Is that mayonnaise or sweat?
GINA," Ugh, fine, I give up. You can take Jacinta."
TERRY," Really? And the other two space heaters, too?"
GINA," All of them, you win."
TERRY, I win? I won.
TERRY," Amy, I won!"
AMY," You did it, Sarge. You're gonna get our power usage down."
TERRY, I don't care about that crap. I took down Gina Linetti. I did the impossible. Terry is back on top. Diaper up! What!
JAKE," Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Jason Stentley has been transferred from active duty effective immediately. Captain Raymond Holt will be taking his place, and, yes, he's taking all of us with him."
AMY, You mean-
JAKE," Yes, Amy. We're back on the day shift!"
JAKE, Charles! Medal of Valor!
CHARLES, I know!
JAKE, For getting shot in the butt!
CHARLES," For “exceptional acts of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety.” But you know, six of one."
HOLT," This is one of the NYPD’s highest honors. Today is your day, Detective Boyle."
GERBER," Heroism can’t be measured by a piece of metal, but it’s the best we can do to recognize brave officers who put their lives on the line. It is my great honor to present the Medal of Valor to Detective Charles Boyle..."
GERBER, ...and Sergeant Peanut Butter!
JAKE," Oh my god, Charles is getting the same prize as a horse."
HOLT, At least Boyle was announced first.
JAKE, Because the horse outranks him! This is amazing!
HOLT," That’s enough, Peralta. This is a huge honor, and nothing can take that away from him--"
JAKE, The horse is pooping on the stage! Sergeant Peanut Butter is pooping on the stage!
HOLT, That is unfortunate.
JAKE, Santiago. The bet ends today. Are you ready?
AMY, I was born ready.
JAKE," -- to lose. The whole question was, “are you ready to lose?” And you said you were born that way."
AMY, Twist my words all you want -- I’m winning this bet.
HITCHCOCK, What bet? What are you guys talking about?
TERRY, Seriously? “The bet?” Scoreboard in the briefing room. It comes up all the time. What are you doing all day?
HITCHCOCK," Nothing. Why, you wanna hang out?"
AMY," A year ago today, Peralta and I made a bet to prove who’s a better detective. Whoever makes more felony arrests wins. What are the stakes? And don’t say money, because I know you’re in debt."
JAKE," If you knew anything about me, you’d say “crushing debt.” I’ll bet whatever, because I’m not losing."
ROSA, What about your car?
CHARLES," Not the ‘stang! That thing’s a date- * magnet. I mean, how many girls have you made out with in that car -- six?! Eight?!!?"
JAKE," I’m gonna win, so sure: let’s bet the car."
CHARLES," Jakey, no! Thor would never wager his hammer. Neil Patrick Harris would never wager his showmanship! Losing that car would be the worst thing in the world for you."
GINA, What’s the worst thing in the world for you?
AMY, Being one of those girls in Jake’s Mustang.
TERRY," Then it’s settled: if Peralta loses, Santiago gets his car. If Santiago loses, she goes on a date in said car. They SHAKE on it."
JAKE, That’s a very firm handshake.
AMY, I took a seminar. And now the score is all tied up.
JAKE," But not for long. In eight hours, I will win and then I will take Santiago on the worst date in the history of the world. You made your bed and now you’re going to lie in it. Don’t worry, “bed” is just metaphorical. Or is it?"
AMY," I’m not worried, ‘cause tonight I’m driving home in your car. And then I’m driving to the junkyard, where I will have it smushed into a metal cube, which I will use as a cold, sharp ottoman. Captain Holt exits his office. Charles hobbles after him."
HOLT," Attention. After today’s shift, I’d like everyone to join me at the bar for drinks in honor of Detective Boyle and his Medal of Valor."
GINA," Oh my god, is Peanut Butter gonna be there? That horse is a damn hero."
CHARLES, Peanut Butter will not be joining us.
HOLT, He’s being fêted at the United Nations.
JAKE," Rolly chair! Pen! Gina’s desk! Hello, sir, you look very stoic today. Like a majestic old tree--"
HOLT, I’m not going to give you more cases so you can win your bet with Santiago.
JAKE," What?! Oh, right the bet, I totally forgot--"
HOLT," Granted, this “friendly competition” has led to you and Santiago putting in more hours and arresting more perps."
AMY," Up by one, Peralta! Anything you want to say to your car before you never see it again? “Bye bye?” “I love you?” “I’m sorry I let Santiago sell you for parts?”"
JAKE," Oh hi, Santiago. Do you have any dietary restrictions that Medieval Times should know about? I’m booking us a table in the middle of the jousting ring!"
AMY," Yes, 3-1-1? What’s the safest way to set a car on fire?"
HOLT," Both of you have done exemplary work, which I appreciate."
JAKE, And I can see that by the absolutely no indicators on your face.
HOLT," However, you are colleagues. And the fallout from this bet has the potential to put a strain on your professional relationship."
JAKE, Only if I lose. I’m a terrible sport. *
HOLT, Cases will be assigned as they always are. Dismissed.
AMY, Captain! You look--
HOLT, No.
CHARLES," Rosa, hey, would like to have a cup of coffee with me? I got some gorgeous new coffee beans."
ROSA, Sure. That sounds great.
CHARLES," It is great. First, we weigh out exactly"
ROSA, Fun.
GINA, Isn’t that like your fifth cup today?
CHARLES, I’m trying to counteract the drowsiness from my pain meds. I took a double dose after the incident at the ceremony.
PHOTOGRAPHER," Bring Peanut Butter forward. Forward. Forward. Can the little guy just take a big step back, please?"
CHARLES, My name is Boyle! I won the same Medal as this horse! Aaaaaaaarrrgghhh!
CHARLES," The footage of my fall lead the local news, so who’s the hero now, Peanut Butter?"
GINA, Peanut Butter.
CHARLES," Gina, you’re just trying to hurt me to distract yourself from your own internal pain. Also, you should use less * conditioner, because that’s a flat mess. *"
HOLT, What is going on with Boyle?
ROSA, His pain meds are making him weird.
GINA," Ohhhh. This happened to my dad when he got his vasectomy un-reversed. You get all relaxed and you have no filter, so you drop truth bombs all over everyone."
HOLT, Hm. That explains the elevator.
CHARLES," Hello, Captain. I’m worried you don’t find me interesting. I wish there were a third person in here. I’m going to pretend someone texted me."
HOLT," Gina, please keep an eye on Boyle today. He’s going to say something to the wrong person and get himself punched."
GINA, For sure. I would love to see Charles get punched.
HOLT, Try again.
GINA, I will keep Charles from getting punched.
JAKE," Up by two, Santiago. I hope you got your cats a sitter tonight, because I’d hate for them to be lonely while we’re out on our date, having the time of my life."
AMY, I don’t have cats. I live alone.
JAKE, Cool brag.
AMY," You know who doesn’t live alone? The Bardon twins, whom I just busted for a B&E. Tie ballgame."
JAKE, They have the same DNA -- they should only count as one!
HOLT," Sergeant Jeffords, I’m honored to give you back your gun. You are officially cleared for active duty."
TERRY," Thank you, sir. It’s good to be back."
HOLT, I sent Gina out to get a congratulatory card.
TERRY," “Through rain, hail, sleet, and snow, you never fail to deliver. Thanks for being a great mailwoman.”"
HOLT, She did not look very hard. But you * understand the sentiment. *
TERRY," Yes, sir. I assure you, I can’t wait to * get out there and kick crime in the ass. *"
TERRY," Hey baby. Yeah, I can do a quick story. At nap time, I tell my twins about a tiny princess who rides on a sparrow’s back."
HOLT, Childhood is a time of whimsy. Dismissed.
AMY," Ladies and Gentlemen, I present Carl Laudson, who stole 3000 dollars! left! Suck it, Peralta!"
JAKE, Oh no.
AMY," That’s right ‘oh no’-- Oh no, you don’t seem worried. Why aren’t you worried?"
JAKE," Bring in the johns! I ran a prostitution sting through Vice, and arrested thirty guys for soliciting."
AMY, That’s not a felony.
JAKE," It is if it’s your second offense. Which is the case for ten of these gentlemen. Little trivia -- four of them are actually named John! Ironic. Anyhoo, ten more for Peralta. Accept your fate!"
AMY, Never! *
JAKE," Five... four... three... two... one! It’s over. Jake wins! Amy loses! Amy Santiago, you have made me the happiest man on Earth. Will you go on the worst date ever with me? You have to * say yes!"
AMY, ...Yes.
JAKE," She said yes! She said yes! Amy Santiago! Date Time! Time to date! Hi there. Sorry, I’m taken. The woman who lives in that apartment loves me."
AMY," Peralta, this outfit is ridiculous."
JAKE," Should’ve thought of that before you spent all year losing our bet. Chop chop, there’s a lot of embarrassing to do and not a lot of hours to do it in."
AMY, Happy?
JAKE, Yes! You look like every girl I ever had a crush on at every Bat Mitzvah. Let me see the bow. Just like Jenny Gildenhorn. I wish you had braces. Should we get you braces? No -- that’s too much.
AMY, Nice shorts.
JAKE, Thank you. Believe it or not: they weren’t that expensive.
AMY, Do I really have to wear this all night?
JAKE," You know the rules. The date begins now and ends at midnight. I decide what you wear, what you eat, and where we go. Oh, and there’s one last rule."
JAKE," No matter what happens, you’re not allowed to fall in love with me."
AMY, Won’t be a problem.
JAKE, M’lady?
GERBER, Detective Boyle. I just stopped by to *say congratulations. Your medal was well- * deserved.
CHARLES," Thank you, sir. Your breath is terrible."
GINA," Charles, can I speak with you? She leads Charles away, turning back to Gerber as she goes: *"
GINA," Thank you for coming, Mr. President. *"
CHARLES, Where’s Rosa? I haven’t seen her all night. Did you know my wife pays me alimony?
GINA," Okay...let’s take a seat. I’m gonna keep an eye on you tonight, little buddy."
CHARLES, Thanks!
TERRY," Hey, you made it! Captain, I’d like you to meet my wife, Sharon."
SHARON, I’ve heard so much about you. It’s wonderful to finally meet you.
HOLT," And you. Your husband is a hero. If you ask me, he should’ve been up there with Detective Boyle today."
SHARON, What for?
HOLT, For saving my life.
TERRY," He means metaphorically -- like, saving him from paperwork. Paper cuts are a slow death, baby."
HOLT," No, I was referring to how he threw his body at the emotionally disturbed criminal who was trying to kill me."
TERRY, Noooooooooooo!
SHARON, He did what?! You’re back in the field?
HOLT, Ah. I have caused a problem. I think I am...getting a text message. There it is.
SHARON, Why is this the first I’m hearing about this?
TERRY," I thought I told you. Remember, you were half asleep, watching the news and the babies were crying and I said real low, 'Hey baby, I'm back in the field. You want something to eat?' And you were like, 'What?' and I was like, 'Something to eat?' And you said, 'Sure' -- and I brought you an oatmeal cookie? Remember?"
SHARON," You are a piece of work, Terrance."
TERRY, Aw damn. She called me Terrance! I’m * doomed. *
TERRY," God, I wished I weighed less. This isn’t even making me warm."
JAKE," Attention, everyone! Obviously, this is Charles’ night. But forget about that for a second, and admire, take pictures,and comment on every aspect of-- this."
AMY, Ugh. Permission to go to the bathroom?
JAKE," Granted. First of three. Use them wisely. Congrats again, buddy, I really am proud of you. Still wearing the medal, huh?"
CHARLES," Yes, I want women to be impressed by me."
JAKE," Allllright... Well, sorry I can’t stay, but I’ve got a terrible night planned for Amy. First up, the mall Photo Studio for our official date portrait. The picture will be the two of us playing one saxophone. Then, a dinner of peel-andeat shrimp at a dangerously cheap seafood restaurant. And then: I have contracted a youth choir to serenade us. * Okay, let’s hear it."
YOUTH CHOIR, Saaaaan-tiago! Santiago! Santiago! Saaaaan-tiago! You su-u-ck so bad!
JAKE, They’re gonna sing to her at midnight in the middle of Times Square. She and 5000 German tourists will remember that moment for the rest of their lives.
CHARLES," Jake, do you know why little boys pull little girls’ pigtails on the playground?"
JAKE," ‘Cause they’re so easy to grab, they’re begging to be pulled."
CHARLES, Because they like the girls and it’s the only way they know how to get their attention.
JAKE, ...What are you saying?
CHARLES," All of this teasing and this elaborate date... somewhere, down deep, you like Amy. Like: “like her,” like her."
JAKE," Okay, that’s straight-up insane."
CHARLES, How much did you spend on tonight?
JAKE," Don’t worry about it. Fourteen hundred dollars. But it’s all on credit cards, so really, five dollars a month for the next 2000 years. I do not like Amy!"
CHARLES, You’re putting a lot of effort into a joke. Why don’t you just sit down and have a real conversation with her?
JAKE," Charles, you live in your ex-wife’s new boyfriend’s basement. I don’t think I’m gonna take advice from you."
CHARLES, I’m ashamed of my living situation!
GINA," Hey, you hiding? I love hiding. Who are * we hiding from? *"
ROSA, I’m avoiding Boyle and his truth bombs.
CHARLES, I sometimes worry I’m going to become you.
ROSA, He keeps saying he wants to talk to me. I’m afraid he’s going to tell me he loves me or propose or something.
GINA," He should smelt the bullets from his butt and make you a ring. Oh my god, I’m gonna cry..."
ROSA, Boyle dove in front of those bullets for me. I can’t be mean to him -- I watched him make coffee for 28 minutes this morning. But I also don’t want to lead him on...
GINA," Well, Holt told me not to let him get hurt tonight, so I will keep him away from you."
CHARLES, Have you seen Rosa?
GINA, Rosa died eight years ago. Let’s get you a drink.
JAKE," Attention, everyone! We are about to leave, but now, for the first time as winner and loser, Santiago and I will perform the steerage jig from the film, “Titanic,” which we have in no way practiced."
CHARLES, Romantic.
JAKE, No. Embarrassing.
AMY, I hate your guts.
JAKE," Channel that passion into the dance, baby."
HOLT, Peralta.
JAKE, Scully. Tag in.
SCULLY, Okay!
HOLT," One of our informants just called. We’ve been tracking a crew that lifts cargo from Laguardia. The CI knows where the trucks unload, and I need you to go stake out the drop-site."
JAKE," Sir, I’m right in the middle of this date and I can’t reschedule. I have far, far too many non-refundable deposits. I’m renting a tiger cub by the hour!"
HOLT, For what?
JAKE, Don’t even know. Waiting for inspiration.
HOLT, This is not a negotiation. Go.
JAKE," Fine. But I’m taking Santiago, so the minute we’re done we’re back to the date. Darling? Brief pause. Duty calls."
AMY, Thank god. They head out.
SCULLY, Gina! Tag in!
GINA, Not even if it would cure cancer.
AMY, I’m so happy to be out of that dress. It was weirdly hot.
JAKE," Oh yeah, it was a cotton-plastic blend. But don’t get too comfortable. We’re gonna catch these guys and get right back to the worst night of your life. Ugh. I have to cancel our theater reservation."
AMY, I don’t even want to know.
JAKE," Then I’ll tell you! It was an interactive musical called, “Uncle Milton’s Crazy Armenian Funeral.” You were going to be dragged on stage to play the nanny he died in bed with."
AMY," Ha ha. I’m so happy LaGuardia was robbed tonight. Hopefully, someone will also rob JFK."
JAKE," Don’t worry, there’s plenty of date left, including a grand finale at midnight. *"
CHOIR BOY," For you suck at detective * work, Amy! *"
YOUTH CHOIR," Santiago, Santiago, * Santiago... * *"
JAKE," It’s gonna be great. For me and the kids. They get to stay up so late! * Is that the truck? Please let it be-- Nope. “Artisanal Soft Serve.” Thanks a lot, Brooklyn!"
SHARON, Why would you go back in the field and not tell me?
TERRY, You don’t tell me everything you do. Like when you bought our girls those fur vests!
SHARON, You love those vests!
TERRY," Yeah, because they’re adorable! But I wasn’t consulted. Baby, I’m sorry. Captain’s life was in danger and I just did what I had to do. It was an impulse decision."
SHARON, I guess I can kind of understand that.
HOLT," Sharon, I have to apologize. I want to assure you that the call to put Sergeant Jeffords in the field wasn’t some spur of the moment, impulse decision. It’s been in the works for a few months now."
SHARON, Months? Terry said it just happened. You need to get your stories lined up.
HOLT, Perhaps I should stop talking to your wife.
TERRY, That’s a good call.
AMY, Ten pm. These wonderful thugs have saved me another hour of humiliation.
JAKE," Yeah, well, I’m not giving up. There’s still time for us to get back to the worst date of your life."
AMY, Hmmm no. Nothing will ever be worse than the date I had with my aunt’s dentist...
AMY, What was your worst date ever?
JAKE, It’s like a fifty-way tie. Recently I went out with a lady who thought our president’s name was “The Rock Obama.”
JAKE," Hey, those people left the door open. I bet that roof has a better vantage point."
AMY, And I bet it doesn’t smell like old cheese.
JAKE, Hey. That’s offensive. It’s old meat.
SHARON," What else don't I know, Terrance? Are you cooking meth? Are you breakin' bad? How many phones do you have?"
HOLT," I’m sorry. I need to clarify something I said earlier. Technically, Sergeant Jeffords was correct when he said his choice to go back in the field that night was an impulse decision. He didn’t even take the time to stop and gear up--"
SHARON, WHAT?! You weren’t wearing your vest?
HOLT, Oh goodness. Ohhhhhh my. I shouldn’t have said that. I feel I may have made things worse.
CHARLES," Wait! I can fix this, Ray. Sorry, butt meds, Ray. Can’t stop saying Ray. Ray Ray Ray Ray."
TERRY," Now’s not a good time, Boyle-- Sharon puts her hand over Terry’s mouth."
SHARON, Hush. I want to hear this.
HOLT," Boyle, let’s not-- "
CHARLES," Hush. Truth time: We love your husband. He’s a great cop. We will do anything to protect him. And you have incredibly attractive hands. And you! What the hell are you doing, lying to your wife?! Unless you want to move into my ex-wife’s new boyfriend’s basement with me, you have to man up. Don’t you ever keep anything from this beautiful woman again! Seriously, you are beautiful. And if he ever lies to you again, you can call me."
TERRY," I’m sorry, honey. I just didn’t want to worry you."
SHARON," Hey. I’m always gonna worry about you. But if you say you’re ready, then get your ass back in the field. But next time you keep something from me, I will leave you for this short earnest man and his ex-wife’s new boyfriend’s apartment."
CHARLES," I know you’re kidding, but Hercules is actually a very good landlord. Sometimes when they go on nice vacations, I’m allowed to use the hot tub."
JAKE," Sleep well, Brooklyn, for tonight I am your guardian. I don’t know how Batman does it. This is * so scary. Hey, can you hand me the binoculars? They’re in my stakeout bag."
AMY, Your stakeout bag is 98 percent nuts. *
JAKE," Yeah, I get snacky. Nuts are great for you, they don’t have any fat."
AMY," Jake, that’s not true at all. That is waaaay off base. They eat nuts for a beat. Amy notices something."
AMY, I think a pigeon just flew out of your car.
JAKE," Oh. Yeah, the windows don’t go up."
AMY," I don’t know why I fought so hard to get that car -- it’s kind of a piece of crap. Honestly, why are you so into it?"
JAKE, You really want to know? It reminds me of my first time.
AMY, Ewwww...
JAKE," No, not that, my first arrest. Get your disgusting mind out of the gutter. I was two days out of the academy. I’m super nervous. I see a guy run out of a * bodega with a handful of cash."
AMY, “Crushing debt.” I remember my first arrest. I was seven.
YOUNG AMY, There are two ways this can go down: the easy way or the hard way. Oh yeah?! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
JAKE, The doll was in the right -- the robot was resisting arrest.
AMY," That’s what I said. And the judge, a stuffed owl, agreed. He was later disbarred for accepting bribes. I was a weird kid. You know, I don’t think we’ve ever just sat down and had a real conversation. It’s kind of nice. Nut? She tosses one in his mouth. He catches it. "
JAKE, Dude. Are you trying to catch it in your nose?
AMY, I got it. I got it.
JAKE," It’s Holt. Keep practicing. ...I can still make it to Times Square... * Eh, that’s okay, Captain. Don’t send the relief team. We’re already here, and I’m kind of curious to see what happens."
AMY, What did Holt want?
JAKE, Just checking in. How you doing -- any better?
AMY, Yup -- watch. The key is volume.
JAKE," Awesome. Volume me! * Tell me the truth, if you’d won my car would you really have destroyed it?"
AMY," No. I was gonna drive it...so I could learn stick. It would’ve been like... Errreggggh. Clunk! Errrrrr. Clunk. Errrr. Oh no, I just scraped off the fender! Erreggh..."
JAKE, Look. There’s our guy.
AMY, What’s the play here?
JAKE," Just follow my lead. Give me the ring. Now give me some nuts. I’m snacky. You know what, honey, fine! I’ll ask the guy, will that make you happy?! Excuse me, sir --"
PERP, We’re kinda busy here.
JAKE, My girlfriend thinks we’re lost.
AMY, No. I know we’re lost. I think he’s an idiot.
JAKE," Idiot?! You know why we’re out here in the middle of the night, Susan? I was going to propose to you at midnight on the Brooklyn Bridge, where we met."
AMY, Brooklyn Bridge?! We met on the Manhattan Bridge! You dumb moron!
JAKE, You know what? This is over. Say goodbye to this ring and everything it stood for!
AMY, Oh! You son of a bitch! The two men hurry over. *
PERP, Hey! Stop yelling!
JAKE, Don’t tell Susan what to-- NOW! NYPD! Get down! *
AMY, NYPD! You’re under arrest! As they cuff the perps:
JAKE, Nice work.
AMY," You, too. Alright, let’s go."
JAKE," Uhhh, actually, I really need to find that ring -- it cost a fortune."
CHARLES," Hey, I need to talk to you. "
ROSA, Uh oh. It’s happening.
CHARLES, Remember when I took those bullets for you?
ROSA," Okay, let’s do this. You’re sweet, but--"
CHARLES," I didn’t know it was you. When I jumped in front of the bullets, I didn’t know who I was protecting. I just saw a gun and an NYPD vest so I dove on instinct. You’ve been extra nice to me because you thought I risked my life for you, but I only did what every good cop would do. When you finally go out with me, and you will, it’ll be because I do things that only Charles Boyle would do. Um, actually, I left my coat in -- it’s blue, calf-length. You know what? I don’t need it. But it is really cold. It’s -- I see it -- can we just switch?"
HOLT, Excellent job on the stakeout last night. I’m glad to see you two still work well together despite that ridiculous bet.
AMY, Thanks. Me too.
HOLT, And I appreciate you turning down the relief team. I’m not sure they would’ve been able to make that bust.
AMY, Yeah... right... relief team.
GINA," Hey, Charles, what do you think about Scully’s shirt?"
CHARLES, I think it’s really elegant.
GINA, He looks like an eggplant.
HOLT, No. It’s nine am.
CHARLES," Hey Rosa, I got a new shipment of beans. They’re exquisite. Want a cup?"
ROSA, Not even a little bit.
AMY, So... sorry you lost so much money last night. Guess you can add it to your list of bad dates.
JAKE," Nah, it goes on the good date list. You know -- ‘cause we caught the bad guys."
AMY, That’s a very mature way to look at it.
JAKE," Well, I’m a very mature man."
AMY, That’s me...
JAKE," Oh no! No, no, no, I forgot to cancel--"
DELIVERY GUY," Special Delivery from Jake Peralta...to say, “Thanks for last night.”"
JAKE," I’ll take this bullet for you, Amy!"
JAKE, Ew! I deserve a Medal of Valor for this!
TERRY, Nine-Nine!
ALL, Nine-Nine!
JAKE, Come on and party tonight!
